Using the current study's large global multi-source sample, our findings illuminate that compliance-enforcement explained significant incremental variance in both organization financial and operational performance and organization corporate social responsibility performance beyond that of the commitment-inducement approach alone. Moreover, the highest levels of both performance outcomes were obtained by organizations that simultaneously used both commitment-inducement and compliance-enforcement; that is, hybrid governance. Compliance-enforcement was also found to have a more substantive relative effect on organization financial and operational performance while commitment-inducement was found to have a more substantive relative effect on organization corporate social responsibility performance. Furthermore, as hypothesized, at the between country-level, the relationship between the commitment-inducement approach of managing people and work and corporate social responsibility performance was found to be more negative both for a high individualism than a low individualism culture and for a high uncertainty avoidance than a low uncertainty avoidance culture, respectively.

In this study, we consider the impact of two reasons employers choose to use contingent workers (to enhance standard employee employment stability and to reduce labor costs) on standard employee withdrawal behaviors (absenteeism and turnover). We posit that when the aim of using contingent labor is to enhance standard employee employment stability (employment stability contingent labor strategy or ESCLS), the effects on standard employee withdrawal behaviors will differ from when the aim is to reduce labor costs (labor cost contingent labor strategy, or LCCLS). Using a sample of 90 firms that employ a mixed workforce, we examine the influence of ESCLS, LCCLS, and high investment HR systems (HIHRS) on standard employee withdrawal behaviors at the firm level. In addition to supporting the hypothesized direct (positive) effect of LCCLS on standard employee withdrawal behaviors, this study's results support the hypothesized moderating effects of HIHRS on the negative relationship between ESCLS and standard employee withdrawal behaviors and the positive relationship between LCCLS and standard employee withdrawal behaviors. Implications for research and practice and suggestions for further research are discussed. \u00a9 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005545309", "authid": "7005545309", "authname": "Way S.A.", "surname": "Way", "given-name": "Sean A.", "initials": "S.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60030638"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602427058", "authid": "6602427058", "authname": "Lepak D.P.", "surname": "Lepak", "given-name": "David P.", "initials": "D.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60120424"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16467429900", "authid": "16467429900", "authname": "Fay C.H.", "surname": "Fay", "given-name": "Charles H.", "initials": "C.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60120424"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24789157400", "authid": "24789157400", "authname": "Thacker J.W.", "surname": "Thacker", "given-name": "James W.", "initials": "J.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60190568"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7005545309"}

The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and usability of using domestic-scale 3D food printer as an assistive technology to print pureed food into attractive food shapes for people with dysphagia. Materials and Methods: In total, 16 participants engaged in the unfamiliar, novel process of using a domestic-scale 3D food printer (choosing, printing, tasting), designed for printing pureed food, and discussed their impressions in focus group or individual interviews. Results and Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrated that informed experts who were novice users perceived the 3D food printing process to be fun but time consuming, and that 3D food printers might not yet be suitable for people with dysphagia or their supporters. Slow response time, lack of user feedback, scant detail on the appropriate recipes for the pureed food to create a successful print, and small font on the user panel interface were perceived as barriers to accessibility for people with disability and older people. Participants expected more interactive elements and feedback from the device, particularly in relation to resolving printer or user errors. This study will inform future usability trials and food safety research into 3D printed foods for people with disability and dysphagia. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION 3D food printers potentially have a role as an assistive technology in the preparation of texture-modified foods for people with disability and dysphagia. To increase feasibility, 3D food printers should be co-designed with people with disability and their supporters and health professionals working in the field of dysphagia and rehabilitation. Experts struggled to be able to print 3D pureed shapes owing to relatively low usability of the 3D food printer tested with problems using the interface and resolving problems in the print. 3D food printing is a fun and novel activity and may help to engage people with disability and dysphagia in making choices around the shape of the food to be printed.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801346687", "authid": "7801346687", "authname": "Hemsley B.", "surname": "Hemsley", "given-name": "Bronwyn", "initials": "B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25421514900", "authid": "25421514900", "authname": "Dann S.", "surname": "Dann", "given-name": "Stephen", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008950"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57685612400", "authid": "57685612400", "authname": "Reddacliff C.", "surname": "Reddacliff", "given-name": "Courtney", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212994934", "authid": "57212994934", "authname": "Smith R.", "surname": "Smith", "given-name": "Rebecca", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14121166200", "authid": "14121166200", "authname": "Given F.", "surname": "Given", "given-name": "Fiona", "initials": "F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15126782000", "authid": "15126782000", "authname": "Gay V.", "surname": "Gay", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55234419400", "authid": "55234419400", "authname": "Leong T.W.", "surname": "Leong", "given-name": "Tuck Wah", "initials": "T.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195457613", "authid": "57195457613", "authname": "Skellern K.", "surname": "Skellern", "given-name": "Katrina", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "10", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57967424800", "authid": "57967424800", "authname": "Bull C.", "surname": "Bull", "given-name": "Chriss", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "11", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55516694300", "authid": "55516694300", "authname": "Palmer S.", "surname": "Palmer", "given-name": "Stuart", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "122554109"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "12", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203104315", "authid": "57203104315", "authname": "Balandin S.", "surname": "Balandin", "given-name": "Susan", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018805"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Yet, while current research emphasizes success stories, little is known about how firms can leverage the full potential of their social media use for open innovation. In this paper, the authors address this gap by conducting a configurational analysis to develop an integrative taxonomy of social media-enabled strategies for open innovation. This analysis stems from the integration of internal and external variables such as social media communication activities, organizational innovation seekers, potential innovation providers, the stages of the open innovation process, and their relationship with different performance outcomes and barriers to social media adoption for open innovation. Through an empirical study of 337 firms based in eight countries, four clusters have been identified that are characterized as distinct strategies: \u201cmarketing semi-open innovators,\u201d \u201ccross-department semi-open innovators,\u201d \u201ccross-department full process semi-open innovators\u201d and \u201cbroad adopters open innovators.\u201d The findings reveal the trade-offs associated with different strategies for implementing social media for open innovation and provide insights of the use of these strategies. By doing so, they suggest a more nuanced approach that contrasts with the traditionally positive (or even rosy) depiction of the effects of social media on open innovation. Accordingly, managers are encouraged to contemplate their organizational competencies, capabilities, and their strategic intent when drafting social media strategies for open innovation. Selective approaches, along with greater adoption leading to greater benefits, are shown to be more rewarding than a middle way that spreads things too thin.

Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP) perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in online community-based OI. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an exploratory case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage with online user communities on the intermediary\u2019s platform. Results incorporate both the intermediary and clients\u2019 perspective, based on analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients\u2019 online community projects and other archival data. Findings: Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge boundary management mechanisms \u2013 syntactic, semantic and pragmatic \u2013 each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively, and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at the organization\u2013community boundary. The findings show that the pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms, and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge collaboration in community-based OI settings. Practical implications: The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value: Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55523208900", "authid": "55523208900", "authname": "Randhawa K.", "surname": "Randhawa", "given-name": "Krithika", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35318747600", "authid": "35318747600", "authname": "Schweitzer J.", "surname": "Schweitzer", "given-name": "Jochen", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35799878200", "authid": "35799878200", "authname": "Logue D.", "surname": "Logue", "given-name": "Danielle", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Based on multiple interviews with the employees of the global commodity firm Gamma Chemical (around 50,000 employees), the research aims at gaining an understanding of the contextual conditions required to successfully build and leverage individuals\u2019 external social client network ties for business unit ambidexterity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a single-case study at Gamma Chemical that entailed 33 semi-directive interviews, each of which lasted 1-4 h, at different organizational levels (ranging from top-level management to production workers). We had access to three regional business units. The interviews addressed the links between the individuals in the business units and external actors. The authors also collected information about the company\u2019s strategic objectives, the local competitive environment and work organization. Open-ended questions were used to allow the interviewees to freely relate anecdotes about their own network development. In particular, the authors asked the respondents to identify business contacts with whom they interacted privately and to describe the relationships. Findings: The research findings are two-fold. First, and contrary to prior studies, the authors find that individuals\u2019 social capital contributes to both exploration and exploitation at the business unit level. Second, developing and leveraging individuals\u2019 external social capital requires a specific organizational context at the business unit level that allows employees to develop and nurture their personal business relationships with clients. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by the scope of the sample (a study of one large multinational firm). Further research conducted in similar contexts may therefore be useful for comparability purposes and to generalize the results. Practical implications: Several practical recommendations describe how managers can effectively make use of their employees\u2019 social connections with clients. In particular, the results suggest that managers should seek business unit flexibility on the basis of team-based structures, an autonomous leadership style and by actively creating a degree of critical social network tie redundancy, encouraging a shared network culture. These three specific conditions allow employees\u2019 personal client networks to not only flourish but also contribute to business unit ambidexterity. Originality/value: Prior social capital studies have analyzed intra-firm and inter-firm relationships in terms of contributing to firm ambidexterity. However, these findings have often been difficult to translate into specific organizational levels. Given business units\u2019 critical role in identifying and implementing business opportunities for a firm, the authors focus on the micro-foundations of exploratory and exploitative learning by using a social capital perspective to explore the link between employees\u2019 private external social relationships with clients and business unit ambidexterity.

It thus allows for a better understanding of corporate alumni networks and their members, while also contributing to the broader identity literature by further documenting how organizational participants can incorporate elements of a past professional experience into their self-narratives.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116071"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55824163800", "authid": "55824163800", "authname": "Villes\u00e8che F.", "surname": "Villes\u00e8che", "given-name": "Florence", "initials": "F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020188"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Such a perspective is reflected in the organisational literature, for example through the work of Strangleman (1999), Brown and Humphreys (2002) or McCabe (2004), who show how nostalgia can be present in an organisational setting. These works also highlight that nostalgia is a social emotion that is shared and co-constructed; it follows that nostalgia is to be experienced not only individually, but also with others, and thus through a variety of media. This idea that nostalgia is a social emotion has notably been leveraged in marketing, and is discussed in the related literature (see, for example, Cutcher, 2008; Kessous and Roux, 2008), but there is no discussion of the media aspect. Thus, these literatures fail to inform us about how nostalgia is mediated in organisational contexts.

If these remain unanswered, the Foucauldian approach could be relegated to a self-contradictory, ultra-relativist and partial reading grid of 'reality'. In this article, we develop a Nietzschean reading of Foucault's thinking that offers answers to these criticisms, and reinstates it as an independent philosophical project grounded in epistemological assumptions that are coherent with its ontology and methodology. Finally, we suggest that, following Nietzsche, the whole Foucauldian project can be approached as a genealogy of morals. Subsequently, we call on scholars to further explore the 'third generation' of Foucauldian studies which would study management practices as morals understood as an 'art de vivre'. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032545"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Our findings first indicate that the establishment of formal ethical criteria based on the restrictive interpretation of ethics as honesty is not enough to resolve the ethical issues that surround the introduction of a technology because it ignores the ethical values shared by most actors in the sector in terms of fairness. We show the extent to which lobbying, rumor, technical problems, and public discourse can impact on the interpretations of the technology regarding ethics. Highlighting the importance of incorporating ORAs into the broader context of relationship management that integrates ethics as fairness and not only ethics as honesty serves to illustrate why the future of ORAs might not be as bright as predicted by a theoretical interpretation of the technology that is sometimes disconnected from the realities of the field. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24329049100", "authid": "24329049100", "authname": "Charki M.H.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Mohamed H\u00e9di", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60109562"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55488731600", "authid": "55488731600", "authname": "Charki N.B.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Nabila Boukef", "initials": "N.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60102126"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the motivations for DGBL adoption and implementation beyond pedagogical ones, the authors use organizational theories to propose a three-dimensional framework in which pedagogical motivation is articulated with political (linked to local characteristics) and institutional (linked to the macro-environment) motivations. They then study the respective importance the three kinds of motivation in the adoption decisions and the implementation process of DGBL. To this end, they conducted a retrospective analysis of four embedded case studies in European business schools. Findings - The authors find that institutional motivation plays a major role in adoption decisions while political motivations can contribute to the decision but are not necessarily present. Isomorphic pressure is essentially mimetic for early adopters and combined with coercive elements for late adopters. Practical implications - During the implementation phase customization is mainly driven by political objectives while institutionalized ideas about the best way to implement the game are not typically influential. Originality/value - The study shows that pedagogical benefits are a prerequisite rather than the core motivation for adoption or implementation. Second, the study is a call for both academics and practitioners not to over-rationalize or under-rationalize DGBL and, more broadly, pedagogical innovations and adoption decisions. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Nevertheless, the introduction of online reverse auctions (ORA) in the negotiation process has been perceived as a resource that decreases inter-organizational trust, limiting the possibilities of collaboration. Online reverse auctions enable buyers to achieve tremendous financial savings through a considerable decrease in suppliers' margins and profits. Consequently, online reverse auctions are blamed for destroying buyer-supplier trust and creating distrust among suppliers toward buyers. Indeed, there is a widespread perception among suppliers that online reverse auctions are unfair since they only take buyers' interests into consideration, increasing the suppliers' suspicion of buyer opportunism. Suppliers feel that online reverse auctions tend to undermine relationships, and they feel exploited by the process, consequently reducing their level of trust in buyers. This paper focuses on the outcomes of ORA use in the business relationships of one major French retailer and its industrial suppliers. Based on a case study built upon 70 semi-directive interviews, we propose an analysis of the impact of ORA use in business relationships. We show that it is not the technology of ORA itself which is responsible for trust deterioration but the way it is used. Our results suggest three factors that would allow inter-firm trust to be maintained when using ORA: the management of ORA, the integration of qualitative criteria and the eradication of abuses related to ORA use.", "aggregation_type": "Conference Proceeding", "subtype": "cp", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24329049100", "authid": "24329049100", "authname": "Charki M.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Mohamed H\u00e9di", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Communities play with the rules, they can be adaptable and as such can build resilience within the organization. But this ambiguity, being the foundation of their capacity to introduce cooperation within organizations, is also difficult to maintain. Cultivating communities of practice thus becomes a delicate task for managers who must be able to adopt complex and contradictory behaviours. Five roles that can be fulfilled by management are analysed: stimulation, facilitation, support, control and recognition.

Indeed, employers spend millions annually in sexual harassment litigation and liability costs. Furthermore, current U.S. law effectively makes it management's responsibility to implement programs to prevent and correct harassment, or else face heightened liability. A common element of prevention programs is training, especially for employees in positions of authority. Several states have gone so far as to mandate sexual harassment training. However, little research exists to demonstrate the efficacy of such training programs. It is known that training sensitizes people in recognizing harassment. However, no research has indicated that training enables managers to accurately identify harassment and respond appropriately. This exploratory study addresses this issue by examining whether training quantity (i.e., cumulative training hours), training variety (i.e., the number of training methods employed), and training recency (i.e., the elapsed time since training) predict a manager's ability to (a) accurately identify sexual harassment and (b) recommend an appropriate response. Results suggest that, while training increases sensitivity, training is associated with decreased accuracy in identification of sexual harassment. No relationship was found among the predictor variables and manager accuracy in recommending an appropriate response.

The current investigation examines two of the most popular SNS, Facebook and Twitter, formulating hypotheses around the specific features of each site within college and adult samples. Unlike previous research that has focused almost exclusively on SNS usage, we focused on active usage (i.e., SNS content generation) as opposed to passive usage (i.e., SNS consumption) and included reasons for usage as a potential black box in the narcissism to SNS usage relationship. Results suggest that the features of Twitter make tweeting the preferred means of active usage among narcissists in the college sample, but not the adult sample, who prefer Facebook. In fact, we found no significant direct or indirect relationship with active usage on Facebook for the college sample, calling into question popular press articles linking Millennial narcissism with Facebook use. Additionally platform differences (i.e., microblogging versus profile-based) may explain the importance of active usage on Twitter relative to Facebook. That is, with Twitter, narcissistic motives for usage all manifest through tweeting while Facebook provides other mechanisms to achieve narcissistic motives. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the well-documented and profoundly negative implications of narcissism for workplace environments, this finding suggests a need for future research on the impact of increasing student narcissism in business students and on successful intervention strategies. \u00a9 OBTS Teaching Society for Management Educators 2012. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16041090000", "authid": "16041090000", "authname": "Westerman J.", "surname": "Westerman", "given-name": "James W.", "initials": "J.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35758199300", "authid": "35758199300", "authname": "Bergman J.", "surname": "Bergman", "given-name": "Jacqueline Z.", "initials": "J.Z.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36242883400", "authid": "36242883400", "authname": "Bergman S.", "surname": "Bergman", "given-name": "Shawn M.", "initials": "S.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401992190", "authid": "7401992190", "authname": "Daly J.", "surname": "Daly", "given-name": "Joseph P.", "initials": "J.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "35758199300"}

Results indicated that the likelihood of a team experiencing a full range of leadership behavior increased to the extent that multiple team members shared leadership, and that teams with shared leadership experienced less conflict, greater consensus, and higher intragroup trust and cohesion than teams without shared leadership.

The current study examined the link between narcissism and both SNS activities and motivation for SNSs activities. Results indicated that narcissism did not relate to the amount of time spent on SNS, frequency of status updates, posting picture of others, or checking up on SNS friends. However, narcissism predicted reasons why Millennials use SNSs, such as having as many SNS friends as possible, wanting their SNS friends to know what they were doing, believing their SNS friends were interested in what they are doing, and having their SNS profiles project a positive image. Findings suggest that Millennials' general usage of SNSs is a sign of the times. While narcissists in the Millennial generation do not appear to use SNSs more often than non-narcissists, their reasons for doing so are different. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36242883400", "authid": "36242883400", "authname": "Bergman S.", "surname": "Bergman", "given-name": "Shawn M.", "initials": "S.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36738896800", "authid": "36738896800", "authname": "Fearrington M.", "surname": "Fearrington", "given-name": "Matthew E.", "initials": "M.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36987372800", "authid": "36987372800", "authname": "Davenport S.", "surname": "Davenport", "given-name": "Shaun W.", "initials": "S.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60105252"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35758199300", "authid": "35758199300", "authname": "Bergman J.", "surname": "Bergman", "given-name": "Jacqueline Z.", "initials": "J.Z.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020441"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "35758199300"}

In addition, we draw on organizational learning theory and the concept of absorptive capacity (AC) to articulate the mechanisms through which these systems might influence market responsiveness and firm innovativeness. We develop and validate measures of FHRM systems using a series of four independent samples. Our findings based on a sample of high-technology firms indicate that FHRM systems are positively associated with firm-level potential and realized AC and that potential AC, in turn, is positively associated with market responsiveness and firm innovativeness. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15076949500", "authid": "15076949500", "authname": "Chang S.", "surname": "Chang", "given-name": "Song", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402475356", "authid": "7402475356", "authname": "Gong Y.", "surname": "Gong", "given-name": "Yaping", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008592"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005545309", "authid": "7005545309", "authname": "Way S.", "surname": "Way", "given-name": "Sean A.", "initials": "S.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007776"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/21740760200", "authid": "21740760200", "authname": "Jia L.", "surname": "Jia", "given-name": "Liangding", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60033100"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7005545309"}

The relationship between work-family balance and turnover intentions was fully mediated by job anxiety. The findings indicate that work-family balance affects organizationally relevant employee psychological outcomes (i.e., job anxiety and turnover intentions) and is a predictor of voluntary turnover.

In this study, we consider the impact of two reasons employers choose to use contingent workers (to enhance standard employee employment stability and to reduce labor costs) on standard employee withdrawal behaviors (absenteeism and turnover). We posit that when the aim of using contingent labor is to enhance standard employee employment stability (employment stability contingent labor strategy or ESCLS), the effects on standard employee withdrawal behaviors will differ from when the aim is to reduce labor costs (labor cost contingent labor strategy, or LCCLS). Using a sample of 90 firms that employ a mixed workforce, we examine the influence of ESCLS, LCCLS, and high investment HR systems (HIHRS) on standard employee withdrawal behaviors at the firm level. In addition to supporting the hypothesized direct (positive) effect of LCCLS on standard employee withdrawal behaviors, this study's results support the hypothesized moderating effects of HIHRS on the negative relationship between ESCLS and standard employee withdrawal behaviors and the positive relationship between LCCLS and standard employee withdrawal behaviors.

Previous work has concentrated on strength of identification, but we know much less about form \u2013 how the two identification foci relate to each other in employees' minds. Introducing an innovative methodology focusing on pronoun usage, we identify three empirical forms: single, extended, and coupled. Single refers to when individuals only identify with one entity (in this case the subsidiary). Extended is similar to single in that there is no separate MNC identification, but some MNC identification is intertwined with subsidiary identification. Coupled occurs when individuals identify with both the subsidiary and the MNC separately, and these identifications are also intertwined. We also explore some work-related factors that may provide tentative insights into ways MNCs might manage the development of form of identification. Preliminary results indicate that expatriation, prior within-firm international mobility, prior within-firm role mobility, job interdependence with headquarters, and job interdependence with other units are associated with the coupled form of identification.

As such, the main sample included 24 expatriates. Two local Thai leaders were also interviewed. Qualitative interviews were analyzed inductively using NVivo. Findings: Five interrelated themes emerged from the data: guiding, bridging, emotionally supporting, socializing and indirectly communicating. These themes relate to Asian holistic thinking, Thai culture and humanistic management. Evidence for humanistic leadership was found, albeit in culture-specific ways. Research limitations/implications: Researchers may benefit from studying local, indigenous leadership practices and determining if and how they fit etic concepts such as humanistic leadership.

Antecedents to subsidiary manager identification and commitment to the MNE and subsidiary are explored. Design/methodology/approach: Those in subsidiary manager roles regardless of country of origin were surveyed. Hypotheses were tested using partial least squared structural equation modeling. Findings: For both MNE and subsidiary models, perceived prestige related to commitment. All components of positive interaction related to subsidiary commitment (but not identification), while just one related to MNE identification and commitment. For the MNE model only, collectivism positively related to identification and commitment, cultural distance positively related to commitment, geographic distance negatively related to commitment, and language similarity marginally negatively related to commitment. Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) partially mediated relationships of perceived prestige and positive interaction with commitment in MNE and subsidiary models. Research limitations/implications: This microfoundational approach to psychological attachment in an MNE setting suggests similarities and differences for antecedents in MNEs and subsidiaries, as well as the importance of OBSE. This study is limited by its exclusion of other antecedent variables and types of attachment, and a cross-sectional study design. Practical implications: MNEs can increase psychological attachment by communicating the importance of the MNE and/or subsidiary, developing processes to improve interactions with other organizational units, and demonstrating that employees are valued.

Finally, we suggest how individual-level multiculturalism influences, and is influenced by, social networks and power dynamics in international organizations.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205427300", "authid": "16205427300", "authname": "Vora D.", "surname": "Vora", "given-name": "Davina", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011073"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192239919", "authid": "57192239919", "authname": "Martin L.", "surname": "Martin", "given-name": "Lee", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018805"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55334661900", "authid": "55334661900", "authname": "Fitzsimmons S.R.", "surname": "Fitzsimmons", "given-name": "Stacey R.", "initials": "S.R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003122"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/11241252700", "authid": "11241252700", "authname": "Pekerti A.A.", "surname": "Pekerti", "given-name": "Andre A.", "initials": "A.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60160279"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10244529100", "authid": "10244529100", "authname": "Lakshman C.", "surname": "Lakshman", "given-name": "C.", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60108705"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193986201", "authid": "57193986201", "authname": "Raheem S.", "surname": "Raheem", "given-name": "Salma", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003059"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "16205427300"}

First, the authors aim to investigate the applicability of the five (EO) dimensions of autonomy, innovativeness, risk taking, proactiveness, and competitive aggressiveness to a medium-sized firm. Second, the research seeks to explore firm processes leading to the development of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in a medium-sized domestic US firm. Thus, it endeavours to examine the applicability of EO dimensions as well as the processes by which EO arose in the focal company. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a multi-method approach entailing analysis of archival data as well as semi-structured interviews of executives to examine the applicability of EO dimensions as well as the processes associated with the development of EO to a medium sized firm competing in a Midwestern US market. Such an in-depth analysis of one firm provides rich data, enabling the exploration of EO using qualitative methods. Findings: While the medium-sized domestic US business had high levels of autonomy and proactiveness, it exhibited moderate levels of innovativeness and risk-taking, and only a low level of competitive aggressiveness. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that organizational artifacts facilitate the development of EO and support organizational culture. Specifically, the organizational artifacts of having an ESOP, a flat hierarchy, inter-unit coordination, and customer communication facilitated EO, and reinforced the organizational culture aspects of empowerment, openness, teamwork, quality services, customer satisfaction, and adaptability. Originality/value: This study is among the first to examine all five EO dimensions as well as to use qualitative methods to do so. It also illustrates how EO applies to medium-sized firms, and identifies processes by which these dimensions develop. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16205427300", "authid": "16205427300", "authname": "Vora D.", "surname": "Vora", "given-name": "Davina", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011073"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005713587", "authid": "7005713587", "authname": "Vora J.", "surname": "Vora", "given-name": "Jay", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60017152"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701823570", "authid": "6701823570", "authname": "Polley D.", "surname": "Polley", "given-name": "Douglas", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60017152"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "16205427300"}

We demonstrate the usefulness of this distinction by showing that forbearance plays a major role in national understandings of OCB. Drawing from institutional theory, we argue that country institutional environments affect what behaviours are considered to be discretionary, and thereby impact the perception of forbearance OCBs. In our study of 524 US and Chinese managers, we found that Chinese respondents were more likely to perceive forbearance from abuse of personal power and forbearance from use of company resources as OCBs and as discretionary actions than US respondents. In contrast, forbearance from complaining about trivial issues and forbearance from inconsiderateness were more likely to be perceived as OCBs and as discretionary behaviours by US than Chinese respondents.

Specifically, we suggest that type of MNE impacts the relative magnitude of DOI, while type of MNE, cultural distance, and institutional distance affect the form of DOI. In turn, relative magnitude of DOI is posited to impact fulfillment of subsidiary manager roles, subsidiary-parent cooperation, and knowledge transfer.

With a multistep process in Study 1, the authors develop and validate a territorial expanding scale.

Territorial defending correlates negatively with information exchange, territorial expanding is positively related to it, and territorial marking has no relationship with information exchange. Information exchange is positively related to job performance. Job-based psychological ownership impedes job performance through increased territorial defending and reduced information exchange, especially among employees with a prevention focus.

Drawing on a multi-motive model of rejection-related experiences and the cybernetic model of impression management, this study examines how and why ostracized employees might ameliorate workplace ostracism through impression management efforts to enhance their popularity. Specifically, an ostracized worker may employ favour rendering tactics to enhance her or his popularity, as reported by peers, which can help reduce ostracism. In addition, ostracized employees with strong self-monitoring tendencies may be more likely to employ favour rendering tactics and use them more effectively to enhance their popularity and thus reduce ostracism. Data collected from 277 employee\u2013coworker pairs in a three-wave, time-lagged design over 2\u00a0years confirm the proposed hypotheses, tested in a two-stage moderated mediation model. These findings have theoretical implications for ostracism research, as well as practical implications to help employees and organizations overcome ostracism. Practitioner points: Being ostracized often prompts self-focused responses, but to reduce it, ostracized employees instead should pay attention to others and seek to help others to alter the treatment they receive from others.

Two field studies were conducted to test our hypotheses. Study 1 explored the underlying mechanisms through which leader self-sacrifice influences team/leader work engagement. Study 2 replicated and extended the findings of Study 1 by further testing the moderating role of leader competence. Our results indicated that team affective commitment to leaders acts as a key mediator of the positive relationship between leader self-sacrifice and team work engagement, and that leader depletion serves as a crucial mechanism underlying the negative relationship between leader self-sacrifice and leader work engagement. Additionally, leader competence affects how team members view self-sacrificing leaders and the extent to which self-sacrificing leaders consume their energy. For competent leaders, the positive influence of leader self-sacrifice on team work engagement (via team affective commitment to leaders) is stronger, and the negative influence of leader self-sacrifice on leader work engagement (via leader depletion) is weaker. Practitioner points: To avoid self-sacrificing leaders being seriously depleted, organizations should design activities or training programmes to help leaders replenish self-control resources and, if possible, increase their self-control capacity. To encourage team members\u2019 investment in their work, leaders may need to establish psychological attachment and bonds with members to motivate them to repay sacrificial behaviours by fully engaging in the work.

Drawing on the\u00a0conservation of resources theory, we propose that low team performance may elicit abusive supervision by making supervisors emotionally exhausted. Furthermore, when faced with low team performance, supervisors with a high prevention focus may experience greater emotional exhaustion and thus display more abusive behaviours, while supervisors with a high promotion focus may be less likely to feel emotionally exhausted and thereby exhibit fewer abusive behaviours. We tested our hypotheses using three-wave survey data collected from 130 teams within an organization. Findings showed that supervisors' emotional exhaustion mediated the negative effect of team performance on abusive supervision, while only prevention focus moderated the indirect effect of team performance on abusive supervision via emotional exhaustion. This study contributes to the literature on antecedents of abusive supervision, the relationship between abusive supervision and performance, and leadership literature broadly. Practitioner points: As abusive supervision results from psychological stress in a specific form of emotional exhaustion, organizations need to improve supervisors\u2019 stress-management skills by designing relevant training or education programmes, and help them handle or recover from stress. The study\u2019s identification of the specific stressor (i.e., low team performance) fostering abusive supervision can increase organizations\u2019 awareness of the issue and enable them to take appropriate interventions to reduce abusive supervision. Confronted with low team performance, highly prevention-focused supervisors become more emotionally exhausted and are therefore more likely to abuse subordinates. Thus, in organizations where such a stressor (i.e., low team performance) is salient, practitioners can hire supervisors with a low prevention focus, or assess, select, and promote supervisors based on their prevention focus.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215505757", "authid": "57215505757", "authname": "Fan X.L.", "surname": "Fan", "given-name": "Xue Ling", "initials": "X.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60033100"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58606419900", "authid": "58606419900", "authname": "Wang Q.Q.", "surname": "Wang", "given-name": "Qi Qi", "initials": "Q.Q.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "orcid": "0000-0001-9658-399X", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206077595", "authid": "57206077595", "authname": "Liu C.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Chao", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014966"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57215493904", "authid": "57215493904", "authname": "Cai T.", "surname": "Cai", "given-name": "Tao", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

To address this gap, our study, drawing on the categorization\u2013elaboration model framework, explored both the positive and negative effects of cognitive diversity on creativity/innovation in a single model. Using data collected from 101 teams (including both team leaders and team members) in 10 Chinese manufacturing companies, we identified a dual pathway \u2013 namely, task reflexivity (i.e., positive pathway) and relationship conflict (i.e., negative pathway) \u2013 in the linkage of cognitive diversity and innovative work behaviour (i.e., IWB). Cognitive diversity encouraged IWB via the task reflexivity pathway, but impeded IWB via the relationship conflict pathway. We further demonstrated that perceived support for innovation moderated the relationships between cognitive diversity and task reflexivity/relationship conflict, with cognitive diversity more related to task reflexivity and less related to relationship conflict when perceived support for innovation was high. Moderated mediation effects also indicated that the positive indirect effect of cognitive diversity on IWB through task reflexivity existed only when support for innovation was high and that the negative indirect effect of cognitive diversity on IWB through relationship conflict occurred only when support for innovation was low. Practitioner points: This study informs team managers about the double-edged-sword effect of cognitive diversity on innovative work behaviour and calls for future research on how to manage diverse teams composed of individuals with different cognitions. Cognitive diversity was found to influence innovative work behaviour positively via task reflexivity and negatively via relationship conflict. Therefore, team managers should encourage their employees to rethink and re-evaluate task-related issues but not translate this into emotional exclusion. Perceived support for innovation strengthened the positive effect of cognitive diversity and weakened its negative influence. Therefore, team managers should build up such an environment by showing support and encouragement of innovation in teams of employees with different cognitions.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205755900", "authid": "57205755900", "authname": "Chen X.", "surname": "Chen", "given-name": "Xingwen", "initials": "X.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60183197"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36085706700", "authid": "36085706700", "authname": "Zhang H.", "surname": "Zhang", "given-name": "Haina", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116749"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27867787900", "authid": "27867787900", "authname": "Kwan H.K.", "surname": "Kwan", "given-name": "Ho Kwong", "initials": "H.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60073652"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

Drawing on the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect approach, this paper aims to investigate the curvilinear relations between task conflict and creative idea generation as well as the mediating role of task reflexivity and the moderating role of task complexity. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were carried out to test the proposed relationship. In Study 1, multisource and lagged data collected from 533 employees and 140 corresponding supervisors were used to test the curvilinear relationship between task conflict and creative idea generation as well as the moderating effect of task complexity. In Study 2, the authors extended the findings by exploring the mediating effect of task reflexivity using a matched sample of 350 employees and 99 corresponding supervisors. Findings: Task conflict had an inverted U-shaped relationship with creative idea generation, and task reflexivity partially mediated this relationship. Besides, this association was moderated by task complexity such that the curvilinear relationship was more pronounced for tasks with lower complexity. Research limitations/implications: This study was more or less contaminated by common method variance because some variables were derived from the same sources. Also, task conflict might be necessitated to differentiate and more situational variables should be considered to draw a complete picture. Practical implications: Managers should undertake conflict management according to the levels of task conflict and task complexity. At a lower degree of task conflict, managers might motivate employees to think more about task-related issues; at higher levels of task conflict, managers should act as conflict mediators to reduce the underlying negative effects, especially for simple tasks.

We collected data from 93 supervisors and 369 subordinates at three different time points.

Multi-level structuring equation modeling technique and Monte Carlo resampling method were employed to examine the hypothesis about the moderating role of Zhongyong thinking style in the indirect relationship between abusive supervision and employee creativity through psychological contract breach. These findings provided support for the hypothesis that the indirect relationship between abusive supervision and employee creativity through psychological contract breach is moderated by Zhongyong thinking style, such that the indirect relationship is weakened when Zhongyong thinking style is high, rather than low.

We identify six emerging trends of abusive supervision, including inconsistency of abusive behaviors, comparison between perceived and objective behaviors, reciprocity, team-level climate, coworker effects, and comparisons between theoretical perspectives. Based on a review of those six trends and some emerging findings, we identify and validate the possible positive effects of abusive supervision from an integrated analysis. We also determine the moderating role that Asian culture plays in differentiating the negative and positive effects of abusive supervision. Specifically, we identify the differences between Asian and Western cultures, and then explore the moral mechanisms (i.e., violation of moral standards, conflict of moral principles) through which abusive supervision may exert positive effects in the Asian cultural context. Finally, we clarify our theoretical implications and provide suggestions for future research.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201676793", "authid": "57201676793", "authname": "Zhang J.", "surname": "Zhang", "given-name": "Jialiang", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

We then theorize balancing operations as coping strategies that the follower can use to address the persistence of abusive supervision over time by changing the power imbalance within the dyad. We hypothesize that through the follower's approach balancing operations, the leader is more likely to regard the abused follower as someone who is instrumental to his or her pursuit of goals and resources, resulting in a reduction in future abuse and an increase in the leader's future reconciliation. After developing and validating measures of balancing operations, we test the hypotheses using a three-wave panel design with field data from a real estate company (Study 1).

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Using a multi-level longitudinal design, the authors collected self-reported value data from 32 CEOs and 119 top management team (TMT) members rated their CEOs on transactional and transformational leader behaviors at Time 1; 18 months later, TMTs rated the in-role behaviors and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) of 331 mid-level managers. Also, at Time 2, mid-level managers evaluated their relationship with the organization in terms of economic and social exchange. HLM was used to analyze the data. Findings \u2013 The authors found the positive relationship between transactional CEO leader behaviors and mid-level manager in-role behaviors to be enhanced when CEOs hold self-transcendent values, whereas this relationship was weakened by CEO self-enhancing values. Similarly, the relationship between CEO transformational leader behaviors and mid-level manager OCBs was found to be strengthened when leaders espoused self-transcendent values. Finally, the authors found that economic exchange mediated the relationship between the transactional leadership * self-enhancing values interaction term and mid-level manager in-role behaviors.

The results from a survey of 228 supervisor-subordinate dyads in Chinese firms indicated that subordinates with high political skill are less likely to have their exhibited ingratiation behaviour perceived by their supervisors; however, supervisors with high political skill are likely to perceive ingratiation behaviour demonstrated by their subordinates. Moreover, the most successful condition for enabling subordinates to hide ingratiation from their supervisors is when the subordinates are politically astute and the supervisors are not. Furthermore, when supervisors perceive ingratiation behaviour, they rate low on the job performance and promotability of their subordinates; these low ratings are explained by the undermined personal reputation of the subordinates due to their ingratiation detected. \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36543187000", "authid": "36543187000", "authname": "Wu L.Z.", "surname": "Wu", "given-name": "Long Zeng", "initials": "L.Z.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032744"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27867787900", "authid": "27867787900", "authname": "Kwan H.K.", "surname": "Kwan", "given-name": "Ho Kwong", "initials": "H.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032744"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/11839935500", "authid": "11839935500", "authname": "Wei L.Q.", "surname": "Wei", "given-name": "Li Qun", "initials": "L.Q.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014347"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

However, there were seldom studies examining the influence mechanism of team leader emotional intelligence on subordinate outcomes in teams, and the previous studies often neglected the team context. The aim of the study is to explore the cross\ue4f8level effect of team leader emotional intelligence and team emotional climate on team member job satisfaction. Questionnaire survey on 148 team leaders and 840 team members was conducted. The paper applied hierarchical linear modeling analyses with the software HLM 6.06 to test the hypotheses. The analyses on the matched sample showed that team negative emotional climate has negative effect on team member job satisfaction, and team emotional climate moderates the relationship between leader emotional intelligence and team member job satisfaction such that leader emotional intelligence has stronger effect on member job satisfaction as team emotional climate becomes more negative. First, it is a single time period study and cross\ue4f8sectional research design, which limits our ability to make causal inferences about the relationships proposed. Second, team leader emotional intelligence was reported by team leader themselves, and it will be better to combine self\ue4f8report and other\ue4f8report measures of emotional intelligence in the future study. This study extends the existing theory through a cross\ue4f8level framework that examines how team emotional climate interacts with team leader emotional intelligence to affect member job satisfaction, thus enriches the studies on emotional intelligence and leadership, team emotional climate and team effectiveness. The study also provides evidence of group\ue4f8level emotion in China, a non\ue4f8Western cultural country, which enriches the existing body of studies sampling exclusively from Western cultural groups and the research of emotions in organizations at group level. \u00a9 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36518974000", "authid": "36518974000", "authname": "Liu X.Y.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Xiao Yu", "initials": "X.Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013503"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

Using data from 179 organizations in China, we found that both the commitment-oriented system, which emphasized internal cohesiveness, and the collaboration-oriented system, which was intended to build external connections, contributed to firm innovation and, subsequently, bottom-line performance. We also found an attenuated interaction between the two HRM systems in predicting firm innovation. We employed a mediated-moderation path model to extricate the relationships. Results suggested that organizations that implemented both HRM systems to promote innovation might face ambidexterity challenges.

Results of hierarchical linear modeling analysis show that employee job performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and supervisor-subordinate guanxi are negatively related to workplace marginalization.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected data from 258 matched supervisor-subordinate dyads in a Chinese sample. Findings: The results indicate that individuals who use positive emotions in social influence tend to enhance their access to network resources and career growth potential, and those who use negative emotions in social influence tend to erode their network resources and hinder career growth potential. Research limitations/implications: A major limitation of the research is that the authors collected data on both strategic emotional display and network resources from the same source at the same time. Supporting prior research, the results indicate that individuals do use emotional expression as a social influence tactic at work, and that different emotion-focused influence tactics are associated with different outcomes. The study makes evident the need to integrate the emotion and the social influence literature. Practical implications: The results of the study indicate that employees may need to develop greater awareness of their own emotions, and cultivate the ability to convey emotional cues to others effectively.

Originality/value: This study provides a relatively comprehensive model regarding the relationships between abusive supervision and work-family consequences, and a promising new direction for both the leadership and work-family literatures. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36543187000", "authid": "36543187000", "authname": "Wu L.Z.", "surname": "Wu", "given-name": "Long Zeng", "initials": "L.Z.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032744"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27867787900", "authid": "27867787900", "authname": "Kwan H.K.", "surname": "Kwan", "given-name": "Ho Kwong", "initials": "H.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014662"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8859923000", "authid": "8859923000", "authname": "Resick C.J.", "surname": "Resick", "given-name": "Christian J.", "initials": "C.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014662"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

We examine the psychometric properties of the Political Skill Inventory (PSI) and test the measurement equivalence of the scale in a non-American context. Respondents were 1511 employees from China, Germany, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. The cross-cultural generalizability of the construct is established through consistent evidence of multi-group invariance in an increasingly stringent series of analyses of mean and covariance structures. Overall, the study provides systematic evidence that political skill can be treated as a stable construct among diverse cultural groups. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that translated PSI measures operationalize the construct similarly. With some exceptions, the item loadings and intercepts are invariant for the US and non-US responses, suggesting partial measurement equivalence. After verifying the accuracy of item translation, we conclude that any differences can be explained by variation in the cultural value of uncertainly avoidance and cultural differences on a low-to-high context continuum.

We further theorize how the value orientation of employees to power differentials moderates the mediating effects of psychological ownership on the relationship between the two levels of control and employee outcomes. We found that the positive effects of control experiences on some outcomes are mediated by psychological ownership. Additionally, power distance moderates the mediating role of psychological ownership. Our results suggest that, in order to cultivate the positive effects of perceived control on employee contributions, managers should pay attention to employees high in power distance since these individuals are reluctant to exercise control.

The authors collected three waves of data from 80 teams across four business units and employed hierarchical regression modeling and the moderated path analysis approach suggested by Edwards and Lambert to test the moderated mediation model. Leader political skill was found to positively influence team performance via promoting the quality of team communication. Moreover, team task interdependence moderates the relationship between leader political skill and team communication, such that the relationship is stronger when team task interdependence is high rather than low. First, the paper adopts the measuring scales developed in the western organizational context to investigate the relations and phenomena existing in the Chinese organizational context. Future research should adopt the indigenous measuring scales to investigate the relations and phenomena existing in the Chinese organizational context. Second, both political skill and team performance were reported by the team leader, which might lead to common source bias. Future research should allow team members to rate leaders' political skill and the team leaders' supervisors to provide evaluation of team performance. Owing to its importance to team performance, political skill is one of the critical skills that leaders should make efforts to develop. When companies recruit leaders for work teams, they should put more attention on the political skills of the candidates. Moreover, companies should cultivate a cooperative team climate to facilitate team communication. Although Ahearn et al. suggested that leader political skill has positive effect on team performance, they did not empirically examine the specific process and mechanism through which the positive effect occurs. This study argues team communication is a critical mechanism that bridges leader political skill and team operations and outcomes as well. The study adopts longitudinal research design and collects multi-source data to test the authors' model. The study also complements past research by investigating both the mediating and moderating mechanisms in the leader political-team performance linkage. \u00a9 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56948676100", "authid": "56948676100", "authname": "Wang W.", "surname": "Wang", "given-name": "Wei", "initials": "W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57158631500", "authid": "57158631500", "authname": "Cao K.P.", "surname": "Cao", "given-name": "Kun Peng", "initials": "K.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

Analyses revealed that employee fulfillment and perceived contributions predicted particular changes in employer psychological contract obligations, whereas employer fulfillment and perceived inducements predicted changes in employee obligations. The effects of inducements on employee obligation changes and contributions on employer obligation changes were mediated by their respective fulfillment measures. Changes in obligations were greater in the first year of employment than in the second.

Results of a second study using cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys as well as interview data from a sample of Chinese CEOs, top managers, and middle managers supported both the attenuation and the accentuation effects and validated the idea that middle managers can detect their CEOs' values. \u00a9 2010 by Johnson Graduate School.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006812715", "authid": "7006812715", "authname": "Tsui A.S.", "surname": "Tsui", "given-name": "Anne S.", "initials": "A.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003892"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57225065342", "authid": "57225065342", "authname": "Li L.", "surname": "Li", "given-name": "Lan", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "109554461"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

Design/methodology/approach - CEOs, TMT members, and lower-level employees of 200 firms in the telecommunication industry in Mainland China were surveyed. Survey data collected from 123 CEOs, 442 TMT members, and 894 employees and archival data of firm performance were matched for hierarchical regression modeling (HRM) analyses. Findings - Results show relationship conflict reduces team cohesiveness and both relationship and task conflicts are negatively related to firm performance. With relationship conflict, the results show using compromising approach could help reduce its negative effects on TMT cohesiveness and firm performance; but avoiding either type of conflict will undermine both team and firm outcomes. Accommodating approach does not have significant moderating effect on conflict-outcome relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study reveals some interesting insights, but it does not include any contextual variables such as firm culture or team norms or climate which are shown to relate to both conflict types and conflict management approaches. Originality/value - By examining the interplay between conflict types and conflict management approaches, the paper offers interesting insights into the connection between nature of conflicts, conflict management, employee-rated TMT effectiveness, and objective firm performance. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Pingping", "initials": "P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55745238400", "authid": "55745238400", "authname": "Liu S.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Songbo", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

This article examines the role of corporate culture in the SHRM adoption and implementation process. Empirical results from a sample of 223 Chinese enterprises indicate that corporate culture has an impact on the adoption of SHRM, and that different types of culture affect the SHRM process differently. Specifically, group and developmental cultures have positive effects on the adoption of SHRM, but the effect of hierarchical culture is not significant. Developmental culture is also found to have a direct effect on firm performance.

We find that subordinates' emotional intelligence negatively moderates the relationship between charismatic leadership behaviors and subordinate's confidence, and positively moderates that with subordinate in-role performance. We also find that the interaction of charismatic leadership and subordinate's EI dose not obviously influence the affective commitment, continuance commitment and OCB of subordinates.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407080703", "authid": "7407080703", "authname": "Wu W.", "surname": "Wu", "given-name": "Wei Ku", "initials": "W.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24576549500", "authid": "24576549500", "authname": "Huang Q.", "surname": "Huang", "given-name": "Qian Jin", "initials": "Q.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "27170043400"}

Design/Methodology/Approach: A qualitative, theory-generating approach following the principles of grounded theory was chosen as research design. Data were obtained from 63 personal interviews with members of seven UN peacebuilding teams in Liberia and Haiti. These teams were particularly well suited for analyzing the dynamics of identification processes as they constitute extreme cases with respect to team members\u2019 identity diversity. Findings: Our analysis reveals four different processes that occur as individuals develop team identification (TI): enacting a salient identity, sensemaking about team experience, evaluating collective team outcomes, and converging identity. Implications: We can show that team members engage in both individual- and collective-directed sensemaking processes during TI development, thereby using internal (i.e., other team members) and external points of reference (i.e., team-external actors) for ingroup/outgroup comparisons. Moreover, our study reveals different modes of identity convergence (i.e., active, reactive, and withdrawal) which are associated with different types of TI (i.e., deep-structured TI, situated TI, and disidentification). Originality/Value: Although team members\u2019 identification with their workgroup has long been considered important for effective team functioning, knowledge about its development has remained limited and largely without empirical footing from a real-world team context. Our study represents the first empirical attempt to inductively identify the processes that occur in individuals as they develop TI.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55928058700", "authid": "55928058700", "authname": "Huettermann H.", "surname": "Huettermann", "given-name": "Hendrik", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027786"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55928170900", "authid": "55928170900", "authname": "Doering S.", "surname": "Doering", "given-name": "Sebastian", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56232167500", "authid": "56232167500", "authname": "Boerner S.", "surname": "Boerner", "given-name": "Sabine", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "56232167500"}

In addition, they will be most effective when leaders perceive and treat their followers as individuals rather than as members of a\u00a0(sub-)group and when they carefully adjust their behavior to the most critical diversity attribute in the team.

In developing this framework, we integrate the respective literatures on religion studies (e.g. Hicks, 2003), identity-disclosure (e.g. Ragins, 2008) and diversity within organizational groups (Jackson and Joshi, 2011). Our framework specifies three paths whereby the public expression of diverse religious identities can engender relational conflicts. As mediators, we discuss perceivers' attribution of proselytism and religious discrimination, as well as identity threats. Moreover, we examine the moderating roles of actors' and perceivers' religious fundamentalism, perceivers' religious identity salience and minority members' attribution of majority members' religious hegemonial claims. At the theoretical level, we delineate particularities of religious identity diversity that distinguish this diversity type from other deep-level diversity attributes. Concerning practical implications, we argue that it is important to not only foster self-expression, but also to be cognizant of the risks that the public expression of religious identities entails. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507361323", "authid": "6507361323", "authname": "Gebert D.", "surname": "Gebert", "given-name": "Diether", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56232167500", "authid": "56232167500", "authname": "Boerner S.", "surname": "Boerner", "given-name": "Sabine", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56235612100", "authid": "56235612100", "authname": "Kearney E.", "surname": "Kearney", "given-name": "Eric", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004935"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55732433000", "authid": "55732433000", "authname": "King J.E.", "surname": "King", "given-name": "James E.", "initials": "J.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "109583076"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55475003100", "authid": "55475003100", "authname": "Zhang K.", "surname": "Zhang", "given-name": "Kai", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15837793800", "authid": "15837793800", "authname": "Song L.J.", "surname": "Song", "given-name": "Lynda Jiwen", "initials": "L.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "56232167500"}

Furthermore, potential antecedents of work-family enrichment and work-family conflict in the work as well as in the family domain are identified and potential gender differences in perceptions sought. Design/methodology/approachAn exploratory approach was adopted. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 15 expatriates and repatriates that were analysed using content analysis. FindingsWork-to-family conflict was perceived as a time-based conflict, whereas family-to-work conflict was perceived as an energy-based conflict. Work-family enrichment (i.e. work-to-family; family-to-work) was perceived as a transfer of skills and mood. Furthermore, at least in an expatriation context, the work-family interface is reflected in more reciprocal influences than are currently presented in existing concepts. In total, four potential antecedents of work-family interaction were identified: social support at work; development opportunities at work; family social support; and family adjustment. Finally, gender differences in the perception of the work-family interface could be revealed. Research limitations/implicationsFirst, the interviews were analysed solely by one person; consequently, inter-rater-reliability could not be tested. Second, a direct relationship between each potential antecedent and work-family interaction can only be hypothesized. Practical implicationsThe findings enable companies to implement support strategies that foster a positive interaction between the work and the family domain which, in turn, will enhance expatriation success. Originality/valueThe study provides one of the first exploratory examinations of the perception of the complete work-family interface in an expatriation context.

Furthermore, the results should not be generalized since they may be sensitive to the sector under study and the small sample size. First, a curvilinear moderating effect of TMT longevity on the TMT diversity-firm performance relationship is investigated for the first time.

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research design is used, through which the paper examines 47 public schools in India. Findings: Religious diversity, that is, the distribution of heterogeneous religious affiliations in an organization, is unrelated to dysfunctional intergroup conflicts. By contrast, tolerance diversity, that is, the heterogeneity of organizational members' beliefs regarding the question of how strictly religious commandments should be followed, is positively related to dysfunctional conflicts. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study are limited to public organizations in the Indian context. Practical implications: Since religious diversity is not connected to intergroup conflicts, fostering religious diversity in organizations could render the societal norm \"unity in diversity\" more authentic and attractive.

We argue that each pole of a pair of opposing action strategies both energizes and detracts from elements of innovation. Thus, it could be expected that combining opposing action strategies leads to an impasse, as the negative effects of each strategy might offset the positive effects of the opposite strategy. There is currently no viable explanation in the literature for why this mutual neutralization may not occur. We aim to fill this gap by explicating why and how opposing action strategies, when implemented simultaneously, do not countervail each other's positive effects, but rather yield positive synergies that fuel team innovation. \u00a9 2010 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507361323", "authid": "6507361323", "authname": "Gebert D.", "surname": "Gebert", "given-name": "Diether", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60212025"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56232167500", "authid": "56232167500", "authname": "Boerner S.", "surname": "Boerner", "given-name": "Sabine", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56235612100", "authid": "56235612100", "authname": "Kearney E.", "surname": "Kearney", "given-name": "Eric", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60016458"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "56232167500"}

To face these challenges, management initiatives that foster employees' commitment to and support for organizational change are needed in hospitals. Purposes: In literature, a charismatic leadership style has proved to be especially helpful in times of crisis and change as well as an essential antecedent of followers' discretionary behavior in organizations. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate charismatic leadership as a means to enhance followers' initiative-oriented behavior in hospitals. In the hospital context, two situational conditions have to be taken into account. We hypothesized that both employees' job autonomy and stress in the workplace will moderate the positive relationship between charismatic leadership and followers' initiative-oriented behavior. Methodology/Approach: We investigated 543 members of medical staff (physicians and nurses) in six German hospitals by using a questionnaire. The hypotheses were tested by conducting hierarchical regression analyses and interpreting main effects and interactions effects. Findings: Charismatic leadership significantly predicted followers' initiative-oriented behavior. Moreover, our study confirmed the moderating effect of job autonomy. However, the moderating effect of followers' stress was not confirmed by our data. Practice Implications: First, the results of our investigation point at the positive impact that charismatic leaders have on followers' initiative-oriented behavior in the hospital. Several studies have shown that training can improve leaders' abilities in charismatic leadership. Thus, a suggestion for supervisor development from this is not only to provide professional training but also to intensify efforts in training specialized on charismatic leadership. Second, to support followers' participation in change processes, hospital managers should consider if and how the degree of followers' job autonomy can be enhanced. \u00a9 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56232167500", "authid": "56232167500", "authname": "Boerner S.", "surname": "Boerner", "given-name": "Sabine", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25637012600", "authid": "25637012600", "authname": "D\u00fctschke E.", "surname": "D\u00fctschke", "given-name": "Elisabeth", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "56232167500"}

Organizational Citizenship Behavior in the hospital - A comparison between physicians and nurses", "first_author": "Boerner S.", "publication_name": "Gesundheitswesen", "issn": "09413790", "volumn": "67", "page_range": "770-776", "cover_date": "2005-11-01", "doi": "10.1055/s-2005-858795", "abstract": "Aim of the study: The study compares physicians and the nursing staff of a hospital in terms of their extra-role behavior. Matters of interest include the extent of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) shown on the one hand and on the other hand which conditions stimulate the OCB of both physicians and nurses, respectively. Method: The comparison was conducted by applying a questionnaire on n = 70 physicians and n = 112 nurses in a nursing department of a municipal hospital. Results: The results can be summarized as follows: (1) The extra-role behavior in terms of sportsmanship, individual initiative, and conscientiousness show equally high values with respect to physicians as well as nurses. In contrast, nurses rate their own helping behavior towards colleagues higher than the physicians do. Therefore, the extent of OCB does not seem to be job-specific in the narrower sense. (2) Differences between physicians and nurses exist indeed with respect to the conditions for the occurrence of OCB: Although the extent of OCB shown by physicians and nurses is independent from age, department tenure, and organizational tenure, job experience does play a role for the degree of conscientiousness (physicians) and individual initiative (nurses). Furthermore, gender affects the sub dimension sportsmanship (nurses). (3) While job characteristics (job control and stress) play a certain role for the degree of nurses' OCB, the physicians' extra-role behavior is independent from job control and strain. Vice versa, the analyzed person-related characteristics job insecurity and strain play a role for the extra-role behavior of physicians, while the behavior of nurses remains unaffected hereof. In other words: Nurses show the same OCB at high and low levels of strain and job insecurity, while physicians lower their OCB when strain and job insecurity rise. (4) For both physicians and nurses, job satisfaction is the most important predictor for extra-role behavior. Conclusion: When trying to enhance the extent of OCB within a hospital, it is - according to our results - primarily essential to increase the job satisfaction of physicians as well as nurses. Within the nursing department, it is additionally recommended to enhance the employees' scope of action, if possible. However, for the enhancement of OCB it must be kept in mind - according to our results - that with rising OCB the stress (e.g. time pressure and interruptions) rise at the same time. The latter might result in higher strain for employees. In the group of physicians, on the other hand, a person-related approach seems promising: It is essential to reduce the physicians' subjectively felt strains as well as the job insecurity. \u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56232167500", "authid": "56232167500", "authname": "Boerner S.", "surname": "Boerner", "given-name": "Sabine", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25637012600", "authid": "25637012600", "authname": "D\u00fctschke E.", "surname": "D\u00fctschke", "given-name": "E.", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10039732400", "authid": "10039732400", "authname": "Schw\u00e4mmle A.", "surname": "Schw\u00e4mmle", "given-name": "A.", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "56232167500"}

But such openness can lead to problems with coordination that may jeopardize the organization\u2019s success. For example, an open organizational culture is accompanied by parallel processes of closure (promoting orientation, consensus, and trust) that reduce the negative secondary effects of openness (Gebert and others, 2004). It is thereby understood that the creative process in a theater company requires a greater effort at coordination than in scientific institutes. This is why cultural openness in a theater company comes with risk. Empirical results from interviews with 28 research institutes (N = 113) and 13 theater companies (N = 88) show that an open culture in theaters as well as in scientific institutes, is significantly connected to closed culture processes that serve as buffers. Furthermore, openness in a theater company in terms of risk prevention is developed significantly less than in scientific institutes. Also openness when the buffering closure is missing is not significantly connected to success in scientific institutes, and in theater companies there is even a significant negative connection. The need for buffering is thus especially meaningful for the results in a theater company. \u00a9 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56232167500", "authid": "56232167500", "authname": "Boerner S.", "surname": "Boerner", "given-name": "Sabine", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025525"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507361323", "authid": "6507361323", "authname": "Gebert D.", "surname": "Gebert", "given-name": "Diether", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011604"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "56232167500"}

It is a special case of directive-charismatic leadership that needs to be explained because it involves substantive restriction of freedom for the led, whereas in other creative fields (e.g. research and development) a non-directive style of leadership is considered functional to success. Current theory on leadership (e.g. contingency theory) is not able to explain this phenomenon. We develop a model of leadership in the orchestra, from which a specific (directive-charismatic) leader behavior is to be derived from the singularities of this leadership goal and the behavior required of followers. On the basis of a sample of n = 334 musicians from thirty German orchestras, we show empirically that directive-charismatic leadership in the orchestra has a positive impact on the quality of ensemble playing, thus promoting artistic quality as leadership success.

The distinction between an open and a closed organizational culture (Gebertl Boerner 1999) serves as the basis for developing the hypothesis that a relatively open organizational culture promotes the organizational members' willingness to change and an organization's innovativeness and can be interpreted as a response to competitive pressure. This hypothesis is empirically tested on organizations outside the realm of hospitals. The authors then seek to find the extent to which a relatively open organizational culture is salient to innovativeness and competitiveness in hospitals as well and try to ascertain the current degree of openness in hospitals.

Their practices have generated strong criticisms from a police force unsure how to engage them because they lack an empathic understanding of hunters' lived experience. Through a three-year phenomenological ethnography of a U.K. hunting team, we advance efforts across organization research to theorize the role of lived experience in social action. Specifically, we deploy the phenomenological concept \u201cway-of-being\u201d to explain hunters' use of extreme practices. Our interpretive account shows how the multiple ways-of-being that characterize the team's lifeworld suffuse their practices with a complex layered affectivity that is constitutive of the commitment necessary for their persistence. This offers a phenomenological alternative to social psychological models of motivations for vigilantism while also advancing emotions research in organizational institutionalism and practice theory. Practically, our study contributes to the policing challenge of mitigating hunting's harmful effects by facilitating more constructive mutual engagement.

With stories that are at once comical and tragic, de Rond captures the surreal experience of being a doctor at war.

In two studies, including a total of 452 participants in 132 teams, we observe that the presence of cognitively versatile individuals has direct (Study 1) and indirect (Study 2) effects on team performance.

To this end, efforts have been made to design measures of creative personality in hopes of predicting creative performance. Current measures of creative personality all reside at the explicit level, yet theory and research both suggest that a large proportion of personality can also be conceptualized at the implicit level. We address this issue by presenting a theoretical basis for creative personality that operates on an implicit level. Using conditional reasoning methodology, we describe five cognitive biases that serve as justification mechanisms for creative personality. Next, we link implicit creative personality to creative abilities through a developmental process. We then test this model and our new measure of creative personality in five different studies. Our results provide evidence in support of an implicit component of creative personality and suggest that it is a substantial predictor of creative performance.

In Study 2, we re-examined the moderated relationships and found that the relationship between procedural justice and OCB was significantly influenced by masculinity-femininity orientation and that the relationship between distributive justice and OCB was significantly moderated by power distance such that the relationships were more strongly positive when followers were more masculine and higher in power distance. Also, we extended our model to include perceived supervisor support as a mediator of the direct and moderated effects of justice perceptions on OCB. We found support for the mediation model, but did not find the moderated mediation effects we predicted.

But such differences in approach don't necessarily lead to conflicts that are unproductive and damaging to an organization. To investigate such issues, the authors conducted a study of the organizational values of the top management teams in 31 companies. (As defined by the authors, organizational values are the objectives that an individual or group believes are important in running a business, such as industry leadership, employee welfare, and profit maximization.) The authors investigated two specific types of team conflict: task and relationship. Task conflict is characterized by substantive, issue-related differences in opinion. This type of disagreement can be beneficial when it ensures that a greater number of possible solutions are explored and that ideas are battle-tested within the group before significant resources are deployed. In contrast, relationship conflict - characterized by disagreements over personalized, individually oriented matters - is generally detrimental. It corrodes trust, hinders communication, slows the acceptance of ideas and leads to isolation and politicization among group members. When it comes to both task and relationship conflicts, the study results showed that behavior is driven by perception rather than reality. Specifically, the greater the perceived difference in organizational values among members of a top management team and their CEO, the greater the conflict. Interestingly, any actual dissimilarity was not a factor. Thus, the bottom line is that many top management teams are unnecessarily encountering difficulties because of members' faulty assumptions. To lessen this tendency, the authors advise companies to consider the following: establish an appropriate atmosphere for the team; because perceptions become reality, understand and manage them; investigate the gaps between perceptions and reality; and act decisively to correct gross misperceptions.

Based upon data collected from a sample of 70 new ventures, we find that TMT cohesion is negatively related to affective conflict and positively related to cognitive conflict. As expected then, we also find that TMT cohesion is positively related to new venture growth. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

We root our argument in Max Weber's idea of value-rational action as an innate human capacity expressed in value rationality, which refers to actions that derive their logic with reference to a value system. We build on psychological research on personal values to propose that values are complex cognitive resources, distinct from mental representations, beliefs, ideologies, identities, and emotions, that, when deployed in strategy making, affect the attributes of the strategies created. We specify how values affect the value-creation and value-capture potential of firms' strategies by theorizing four distinct functions of values in strategy making: as attentional structures, as valuation lenses, as design principles, and as identity markers. As attentional structures, values direct strategists' attention to specific issues and often unconventional solutions; as valuation lenses, they change the evaluation of relevant markets and resources; as design principles, they influence the prioritization and integration of activities; and as identity markers, they facilitate audience engagement and mobilization.

Individuals can develop multiple identities in the academic domain, and we anticipate that graduate students develop both an engineering identity and a research identity in their engineering graduate programs. Engineering identity development has mainly been investigated with undergraduate engineering students. The literature on graduate students' engineering identity development is relatively sparse, and the phenomenon has been investigated mostly using qualitative studies. Furthermore, research identity development has been studied with non-engineering doctoral students, but very few researchers have investigated engineering graduate students' research identity, even though engineering graduate students engage in research and develop research proficiency during their graduate studies. In this quantitative study, we incorporate findings from previous qualitative studies of engineering identity and researcher identity to 1) assess engineering identity and investigate its relationships with key factors affecting engineering identity development and 2) investigate researcher identity development among other graduate programs to investigate relationships between engineering graduate students' research identity and key factors affecting its development. We developed multi-item scales to measure engineering identity and research identity. Several items were borrowed and modified from undergraduate engineering identity studies and research identity studies in different disciplines. In addition, our survey included items that we generated to measure key factors that prior research suggests may affect these identities, namely engineering and research competencies, interest, and recognition. The survey was completed online by 115 mechanical engineering graduate students from a large public research university. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the items intended to measure engineering and research identities loaded onto their respective factors, and that the items created to measure engineering and research competencies, interest, and recognition loaded onto six factors: Engineering Competence, Engineering Interest, Research Competence, Research Interest, Math/Science Competence, and Interpersonal Skill Competence.

Our framework contributes a theoretical conceptualization that enhances our understanding of organizations' DM efforts, integrates current typologies, and suggests new directions of inquiry for management scholars as well as guidelines for practitioners in the area. \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27667862100", "authid": "27667862100", "authname": "Olsen J.", "surname": "Olsen", "given-name": "Jesse E.", "initials": "J.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027395"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102109403", "authid": "7102109403", "authname": "Martins L.", "surname": "Martins", "given-name": "Luis L.", "initials": "L.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116471"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7102109403"}

One such factor is the support that expatriates receive from host country nationals (HCNs) with whom they work. Researchers interested in understanding expatriate success have not closely examined the phenomenon from an HCN perspective, however. At the same time, although we have gained a significant understanding of the roles of psychological, organizational, and contextual variables in the international assignment, there is still much to be understood about how expatriates' demographic characteristics affect their experiences in international assignments. Current findings regarding the effects of demographic characteristics often are inconsistent, highlighting the need for more complex theorizing. This article reviews recent research on the effects of expatriate demographic characteristics and proposes a social identity approach to understanding how these characteristics affect HCN support for the expatriate. It also seeks to develop a theory that addresses discrepancies in extant empirical findings, provides propositions to guide future research in the study of expatriates, and discusses implications for both researchers and practitioners. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27667862100", "authid": "27667862100", "authname": "Olsen J.E.", "surname": "Olsen", "given-name": "Jesse E.", "initials": "J.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102109403", "authid": "7102109403", "authname": "Martins L.L.", "surname": "Martins", "given-name": "Luis L.", "initials": "L.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7102109403"}

However, organizations vary in the extent to which they respond to the pressures exerted by the rankings, and research to date has not examined why some organizations change in response to the rankings and others do not. This study develops and tests a model that examines how top managers' sensemaking of rankings affects organizational change. Specifically, the model proposes direct and moderated effects of a perceived discrepancy between the position assigned to an organization in the rankings and the position implied by the organization's identity in the minds of its top managers (referred to here as a \"perceived identity-reputation discrepancy\"), on the extent of change undertaken by the organization. The research context used for the study was U.S. graduate schools of business. The results show that, as expected, schools whose top managers believed that their rankings were discrepant from their own perceptions of their school's standing in the industry, were more likely to undertake organizational change. This relationship was moderated by top managers' perceptions of the strategic impact of the rankings, and by the strength and external orientation of organizational identity; the relationship was not moderated by the perceived validity of the rankings. Overall, the results suggest that managerial interpretations and organizational identity work in concert to explain variation across organizations in the extent to which rankings motivate organizational change. \u00a9 2005 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102109403", "authid": "7102109403", "authname": "Martins L.L.", "surname": "Martins", "given-name": "Luis L.", "initials": "L.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116662"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7102109403"}

In this study, we empirically explore elements of relational rivalry between firms (explicit rivalry, capability to compete, and status similarity) drive the intensity of FMC. Using the market for high school recruits among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) football teams as our research setting, we show that these psycho-social aspects of relational rivalry (as well as some product-market based structural aspects) indeed drive FMC. Further analysis reveals that the nature of these relationships is contingent on another underexplored element of FMC: factor quality.

We explore why rivals initiate a specific competitive action at a particular time and situation. Drawing from the philosophy of action literature, we introduce the concept of competitive rationales to examine the primary reasons that cause tactical actions. Given the rapid exchanges characterizing tactical competitive dynamics, we conducted an inductive, multicase study to explore the reasons behind over 800 discrete tactical decisions carried out by 9 professional basketball coaches during 15 basketball games. To garner insight, we develop a conceptual framework revealing their types and scope. Even during intense head-to-head rivalry, most rationales were not rivalrous but were instead organizational\u2014to optimize resource use, strategic consistency, and reputation\u2014or social\u2014to manage relationships. Moreover, the three main types of rationales varied in scope, extending beyond immediate competitive situations and rivals to address longer term, strategic outcomes, and assorted stakeholders. Thus, our analysis reveals these rationales to be complex and potentially difficult for rivals to decipher. It also recasts each component of the dominant awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) model of rivalry, suggesting that awareness is challenged by subtle rationales, motivation drives not only action but also forbearance, and capability is both a requirement and product of action.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35177081600", "authid": "35177081600", "orcid": "0000-0002-2196-5413", "authname": "Andrevski G.", "surname": "Andrevski", "given-name": "Goce", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60016005"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407279089", "authid": "7407279089", "authname": "Miller D.", "surname": "Miller", "given-name": "Danny", "initials": "D."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56003957000", "authid": "56003957000", "orcid": "0000-0001-5755-2939", "authname": "Le Breton-Miller I.", "surname": "Le Breton-Miller", "given-name": "Isabelle", "initials": "I.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002970"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602560326", "authid": "6602560326", "authname": "Ferrier W.", "surname": "Ferrier", "given-name": "Walter", "initials": "W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015941"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "6602560326"}

Our examination of the antecedents and outcomes of complex competitive repertoires develops a more nuanced perspective. Data from 1,168 firms in 204 industries reveal that complexity initially harms performance, but then becomes a positive factor, except at high levels. We use agency and tournament theories, respectively, to examine how key governance mechanisms\u2014ownership structure and executive compensation\u2014help shape firms' competitive repertoires. We find that the principals of agency theory and the pay gap of tournament theory are both important antecedents of competitive complexity, and an interaction exists wherein firms build especially complex repertoires when both influences are strong. Managerial summary: In boxing, the fight does not always go to the bigger or stronger person, or even to whomever throws the most punches\u2014the fight is sometimes won by the boxer who is unpredictable, such as throwing an uppercut when the opponent expected a right hook. Similarly, when companies compete in the marketplace, advantage is afforded not only to those with more resources or who engage in more competitive activity, but also to those whose actions are unpredictable. In this study, we develop the notion of \u201ccompetitive complexity,\u201d which describes the diversity and changing nature of a company's competitive moves. Implementing complex competitive repertoires can be painful in the short term but, if done correctly, can help company performance in the long run.

The effects of competitive actions in disequilibrium environments, such as nascent markets, however, have not been examined. In this paper, we argue that under conditions of high ambiguity, firms can gain competitive advantage from the Gestalt properties present in the sequences of their competitive actions. Such properties, we argue, facilitate investor sensemaking and influence their valuations. Drawing on psychological research on pattern perception and holistic information processing, we investigate the effects of four Gestalt properties-simplicity, predictability, grouping, and motif-on investor valuations of new firms competing in the nascent markets that emerged around the commercialization of the Internet in the mid-1990s. We find support for our arguments that the dynamic properties of action sequences provide firms with advantages and that simplicity, grouping, and motif are associated with increases in the market value of high-ambiguity firms, but not of low-ambiguity ones. Our study advances research on competitive advantage by developing both theory and methods for studying how the dynamic, holistic properties of firms' competitive actions contribute to competitive advantage under varying levels of ambiguity. \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602650556", "authid": "6602650556", "authname": "Rindova V.", "surname": "Rindova", "given-name": "Violina", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116471"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602560326", "authid": "6602560326", "authname": "Ferrier W.J.", "surname": "Ferrier", "given-name": "Walter J.", "initials": "W.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122654"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9535433500", "authid": "9535433500", "authname": "Wiltbank R.", "surname": "Wiltbank", "given-name": "Robert", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004169"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602560326"}

Firms act creatively (introduce a new product, a new promotion, or a new marketing agreement! to enhance or improve profits, competitive advantage, and industry position; successful actions (actions which generate new customers and profits) promote competitive reaction as rivals attempt to block or imitate the action. The study of competitive dynamics is thus the study of how firm action (moves) affects competitors, competitive advantage, and performance. Sometimes these actions and reactions can escalate among firms so that the industry performance is adversely affected; at other times, the pattern of behavior can be more gentlemanly and profitable.", "aggregation_type": "Book", "subtype": "ch", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55704529300", "authid": "55704529300", "authname": "Smith K.G.", "surname": "Smith", "given-name": "Ken G.", "initials": "K.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020304"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602560326", "authid": "6602560326", "authname": "Ferrier W.J.", "surname": "Ferrier", "given-name": "Walter J.", "initials": "W.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015941"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8951231900", "authid": "8951231900", "authname": "Ndofor H.", "surname": "Ndofor", "given-name": "Hermann", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020304"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602560326"}

Specifically, we explore how the capability of firms to compete with a greater number and variety of competitive actions is influenced by the changes in the access to both the structural and relational aspects of social capital. The structural aspect of the social capital is depicted by the network centrality and structural autonomy of the firms in the network, whereas the relational aspect is approximated by the functional variety of the alliance types (e.g., R&D, marketing, manufacturing, finance, distribution, etc.). Our empirical investigation showed that the diversity of the alliance types is positively related to the firms' ability to compete more intensively and with a wide variety of action types. Our findings suggest that it is the diversity and the non-redundancy of the ties with network partners (rather than the total number of alliances) that are most critical for an automaker's ability to out-compete rivals.", "aggregation_type": "Conference Proceeding", "subtype": "cp", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35177081600", "authid": "35177081600", "authname": "Andrevski G.", "surname": "Andrevski", "given-name": "Goce", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122654"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602560326", "authid": "6602560326", "authname": "Ferrier W.J.", "surname": "Ferrier", "given-name": "Walter J.", "initials": "W.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015941"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004398509", "authid": "7004398509", "authname": "Brass D.J.", "surname": "Brass", "given-name": "Daniel J.", "initials": "D.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015941"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602560326"}

The focus is on the specific competitive behaviors or new competitive actions that challengers take to dethrone the leader. The study also examines the competitive actions leaders take to guard against aggressive challengers. Employing Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction, the article describes the dynamic competitive actions and reactions of challengers and industry leaders in what the authors refer to as the battle for king of the hill. Drawing from a sample of nearly five thousand competitive actions in 41 industries over a seven-year period, we found that successful challengers were more aggressive in taking action, carried out a more complex repertoire of actions, were unpredictable in the timing and location of attack, and were able to delay the reaction of industry leaders.

The bulk of the literature assumes that the key cause-effect relationship resides at the individual level. However, individuals do not experience mistreatment in a vacuum, but rather in a complex social environment that shapes interpretations of, and reactions to, individual mistreatment. In this integrative review, we depart from prior reviews that focus primarily on personal experiences of mistreatment and instead evaluate the literature on mistreatment in the context of others\u2019 negative experiences. Analyzing 64 empirical articles on own and others\u2019 mistreatment at work, we identify six key theoretical perspectives concerning how others\u2019 experiences shape individual reactions to mistreatment.

And if so, (b) what mechanisms may explain their fewer brokerage roles? Study 1, a meta-analysis examining gender differences in network brokerage, analyzed a cumulative sample of 15,743 individuals (69 independent samples) to show that women were less likely to be brokers in both instrumental and expressive networks, which partly explained their lower career success. Study 2, a follow-up study with 2 independent samples of new employees (n = 150 and 245, respectively), examined both structural opportunity (job-based opportunity and workplace discrimination) and individual agency (proactive networking) as potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between gender and network brokerage. Results of these 2 samples consistently show that proactive networking mediated gender\u2019s effect on network brokerage that was measured 6 months after the new employees entered their organizations. The predictions regarding the mediation effects of job-based opportunity and workplace discrimination were not supported. Our findings offer valuable insights into the relative positions of women and men in informal structures of organizational networks, advance our understanding of gender inequality in career outcomes, and shed new light on the relative importance of individual agency and structural opportunity in explaining individuals\u2019 occupancy of advantageous network positions.

This growth, as well as disciplinary differences, resulted in mixed views, conceptualizations, and operationalizations. This review synthesizes knowledge and empirical findings from more than 4, 500 studies across disciplines. We summarize several characteristics of social support studied in the literature: quantity and quality, utilization, source, content, format, and consistency. We also identify four dynamic roles of social support in predicting individual outcomes directly, indirectly, and interactively (with stressors): a positivity catalyst, a positivity enhancer, a negativity buffer, and a negativity exacerbator.

Our review of 151 conceptual and empirical articles indicates that organizational research on economic inequality not only encompasses a wide range of topics at multiple levels of analysis but also that this broad-scope literature exhibits conceptual ambiguities and lacks overarching organizing frameworks. To address these two issues, we develop an organizational perspective on economic inequality and clarify it as uneven distribution in the endowment and/or access to resources in a society, which manifests in differential abilities and opportunities to engage in value creation. Following this, we integrate the reviewed research to highlight the bidirectional relationship between societal economic inequality and organizations, and eight mechanisms that drive this relationship.

In Study 1, data measured at two time points (N\u00a0=\u00a01,162) shows that LSKH positively predicts KH among subordinates. The KH dimensions of evasive hiding and playing dumb (but not rationalized hiding) negatively relate to job satisfaction and positively affect turnover intentions. Study 2 (N\u00a0=\u00a01,169) replicates these results with cross-sectional data. Moreover, Study 2 demonstrates that evasive hiding and playing dumb negatively affect empowerment, whereas rationalized hiding has a positive effect.

Empirical research in several disciplines examines how the interplay of pay systems and person-based characteristics (psychological individual differences, demographics, and relative performance or position in a group) relate to important work-related outcomes. We develop a compensation-activation theory that frames compensation design characteristics as workplace \"situations\" providing cues that activate individuals' corresponding fundamental social motives made salient due to chronic or transient person-based characteristics. Where activation occurs, stronger-than-average responses to the compensation \"situation\" are expected.

We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director\u2019s qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board (\u201cboard undervaluation\u201d), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm\u2019s CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been \u201cundervalued,\u201d and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors\u2014even the CEO is more likely to exit.

Results from a sevenyear field quasi-experiment in 20 rural villages in India support the model. Ties to family and community positively, and to men in power negatively, relate to ICT use, entrepreneurial activity, and entrepreneurial profit. ICT intervention also strongly impacts entrepreneurship, with 160 new businesses in the 10 intervention villages compared to 40 in the controls. Results also demonstrate the dynamic interplay of social networks and ICT use. For ties to family and community, the amplification effect is such that the highest levels of entrepreneurial activity and success are observed among women with high centrality and ICT use-effects that increase over time. For ties to men in power, ICT use is associated with increased entrepreneurial activity only when these ties are low, but these interactive temporary temporal patterns do not emerge for profit.

Second, how do indegree centrality and brokerage compare in explaining job performance and career success? Third, how do these personality variables and network positions relate to work outcomes? Our results show that self-monitoring predicted indegree centrality (across expressive and instrumental networks) and brokerage (in expressive networks) after controlling for the Big Five traits. Self-monitoring, therefore, was especially relevant for understanding why people differ in their acquisition of advantageous positions in social networks. But the total variance explained by personality ranged between 3% and 5%.

We also advance the argument that this relationship will be mediated by team member work-related communication density and that the mediated relationship will be stronger when team members' tasks are complex.

However, research shows conflicting results on the direction of PA's moderating influence. Furthermore, past studies fail to differentiate evaluations of one's own rewards versus rewards for others, which is particularly important as reward systems are designed from a third-person perspective. Our experimental design confirms PA's direct and moderating effects on the evaluation of one's own rewards, finding stronger positive relationship for small-to-moderate rewards but weaker positive relationship for moderate-to-large rewards. These evaluation processes further show that individuals high (low) in PA perceive their own rewards as being larger (smaller) than rewards for others.

In addition, the relationship is more negative for voluntary (\u03c1 = -.15) and reduction-in-force turnover (\u03c1 = -.17) than for involuntary turnover (\u03c1 = -.01). Moreover, the meta-analytic correlation differs significantly across several organization- and context-related factors (e.g., types of employment system, dimensions of organizational performance, region, and entity size). Finally, in sample-level regressions, the strength of the turnover rates- organizational performance relationship significantly varies across different average levels of total and voluntary turnover rates, which suggests a potential curvilinear relationship.

They theorize that human capital losses markedly diminish the inimitability of human capital stores initially, but that the negative effects are attenuated as human capital losses increase. They argue further that these effects are more dramatic when human resource management (HRM) investments are substantial. As predicted, Study 1 shows that the human capital losses (voluntary turnover rates)-workforce performance relationship takes the form of an attenuated negative relationship when HRM investments are high. Study 2 shows stronger curvilinear effects of voluntary turnover rates on financial performance via workforce productivity under these conditions.

The plans include pay that is skill-based, job-based, and market-based. The types of workforce-level outcomes include workforce flexibility, attitudes, membership behaviors, and productivity. The paper also assesses the relationship between the success of pay plans and workforce productivity/membership behaviors. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from 214 organizations are used to test the hypothesized relationships using hierarchical regression analysis and partial least square techniques. Findings: Results support a significant and positive relationship between skill-based pay plans, workforce flexibility, and workforce attitudes. Skill-based pay plans, when compared with market-based pay plans, are found to positively relate to workforce membership behaviors, and workforce attitudes mediate this relationship. Similarly, workforce flexibility mediates the positive relationship between skill-based plans and workforce productivity. The success of skill-based plans depends on significant improvements in workforce productivity and membership behaviors. The fit between the pay plan and the facility's climate/culture moderates the relationship between workforce productivity and the pay plan's success. Practical implications: The results indicate that skill-based pay plans are superior for achieving several organizational and employee outcomes. The authors discuss the implications of these results for research and practice. Originality/value: Limited comparative empirical evidence exists on the effects of different types of pay systems on organizational outcomes. The paper seeks to address this gap. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8650462800", "authid": "8650462800", "authname": "Mitra A.", "surname": "Mitra", "given-name": "Atul", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029288"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402490883", "authid": "7402490883", "authname": "Gupta N.", "surname": "Gupta", "given-name": "Nina", "initials": "N.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004862"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55460624200", "authid": "55460624200", "authname": "Shaw J.D.", "surname": "Shaw", "given-name": "Jason D.", "initials": "J.D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60123802"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "55460624200"}

Whether this is good or bad, all things considered, has no pat answer. The chapter also summarizes findings on the link between envy and moral disengagement in organizational settings.

The hypothesized cross-level interaction was supported for supervisor and coworker undermining among a sample of officers from the national police force in the Republic of Slovenia (Study 1), replicated for supervisor undermining among soldiers in the US National Guard (Study 2), and further replicated with group-member undermining among a sample of individuals working in student teams (Study 3).

Pay dispersion may increase effort and provide incentives for high workforce performance levels, but may also inhibit cooperation and goal orientation among employees. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives (individual motivation, institutional theory, organizational justice, and neoclassical economics), this study predicts that pay dispersion will be associated with higher levels of workforce performance when accompanied by formal individual incentive systems and independent work, while pay compression is desirable in the absence of individual incentive systems and when work is interdependent. Survey research studies in two industrial sectors (the motor carrier and concrete pipe industries) were conducted to address these issues. Interactive regression results were generally supportive of the predictions across several measures of workforce performance (accident rates, safety violations, and productivity). Implications of these studies for strategy implementation in terms of compensation theory and practice are addressed.

This research examines the influence of a venture's learning proficiency on the relationship between venture relatedness and operations autonomy. Results from 145 ICVs operating in 72 parent corporations indicate that learning proficiency strongly moderates the relationship between parent-venture relatedness and autonomy, but the direction of the moderating effect depends on the type of relatedness being considered, i.e., either market familiarity or product similarity.

Using data collected from 145 ICVs operating in 72 corporate parents, this research reveals that corporations with more attractive core businesses grant greater planning autonomy to their ICVs\u2019 managers, and planning autonomy contributes to ICV performance. Additional results reveal the moderating effects within our structural model of venture manager experience and the similarity of the ICV\u2019s product to those of other businesses within the corporation. Considered collectively, this research demonstrates why corporations that \u201cneed\u201d their ICVs to be successful \u2013 because of poor prospects in their core businesses \u2013 are most likely to mismanage them. Unattractive core business prospects can be viewed as justifying corporate managers\u2019 involvement in the direct management of their firms\u2019 ICVs. However, venture planning autonomy is needed to avoid placing undue expectations on ICVs as the \u201csaviors\u201d of corporate performance. By extension, this need for autonomy is also anticipated to apply to other entrepreneurial contexts where experimentation and learning are significant concerns (e.g., business incubators, corporate venture capital investments, new venture divisions). Plain English Summary: This research demonstrates how and why corporations that have attractive core business operations are most likely to be good corporate parents to their internal corporate ventures (ICVs), and vice versa. In a sense, when it comes to internal corporate venturing, \u201cthe rich corporations get richer, and the poor corporations get poorer.\u201d Parent corporations with more attractive core business prospects were found to grant greater planning autonomy to the managers of their ICVs, and autonomy is needed to give ICV managers the discretion and flexibility they need when navigating their ventures though unchartered business territory. Overall, this research demonstrates the importance of corporate managers (1) granting ICV managers autonomy in planning their venture operations, (2) being willing to consider engaging in internal corporate venturing even though their firms\u2019 existing, core business operations may be attractive (i.e., before these ICVs \u201cneed\u201d to be successful), and (3) not putting too much pressure on ICVs to \u201cperform,\u201d and avoiding meddling in the management of those ventures, when prospects in the corporation\u2019s core business are unattractive. We argue that autonomy is likely efficacious in most entrepreneurial contexts where experimentation and learning are significant concerns (e.g., business incubators, corporate venture capital investments, new venture divisions).", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60010783"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24481294100", "authid": "24481294100", "authname": "Garrett R.P.", "surname": "Garrett", "given-name": "Robert P.", "initials": "R.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60028599"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14053594000", "authid": "14053594000", "authname": "Bouncken R.B.", "surname": "Bouncken", "given-name": "Ricarda B.", "initials": "R.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023208"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56286807200", "authid": "56286807200", "authname": "Ratzmann M.", "surname": "Ratzmann", "given-name": "Martin", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023208"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58606593500", "authid": "58606593500", "authname": "Muhammad M.", "surname": "Muhammad", "given-name": "Malcolm", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "130217463"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

This paper examines the case for EO at the individual level (Ind.EO). We consider the EO legacy concerns, and the various theoretical implications and benefits of doing so.

Finally, we outline a research agenda and discuss the contributions and potential implications for Ind.EO research across the wider entrepreneurship discipline.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195732382", "authid": "57195732382", "orcid": "0000-0003-1645-4667", "authname": "Clark D.R.", "surname": "Clark", "given-name": "Daniel R.", "initials": "D.R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60115928"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57199864092", "authid": "57199864092", "orcid": "0000-0003-2624-1470", "authname": "Pidduck R.J.", "surname": "Pidduck", "given-name": "Robert J.", "initials": "R.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60137301"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005604102", "authid": "7005604102", "orcid": "0000-0003-2282-5196", "authname": "Lumpkin G.T.", "surname": "Lumpkin", "given-name": "G.

Using qualitative methods, we systematically examine how luck is invoked in post hoc performance evaluations in 70 interviews with successful entrepreneurs from the podcast How I Built This. Our analysis reveals that entrepreneurs perceive the influence of luck as a multifaceted combination of both structural and agentic factors.

A vehicle to do so is post-formational directives. These directives have ambivalent effects that explicate by sub-mechanisms of post-formational directives informed by speech-act theory. In short, post-formational directives can increase the control and clarity of the product innovation components. Yet, they can limit suppliers' autonomy and creativity and, as such, might reduce innovation. Our study clarifies the ambivalent effects of post-formational directives. Our empirical findings of 470 suppliers in alliances indicate that post-formational directives improve product innovation when associated with inter-organizational learning from the buyer.

We leverage this conceptualization to examine the presumed state of irreconcilable differences between the Miller (1983)/Covin and Slevin (1989) and Lumpkin and Dess (1996) conceptualizations of EO. This research proposes that these conceptualizations are reconcilable when the problem is reframed to consider how EO is manifest as an organizational attribute at and across multiple levels of analysis. Like the blind men and the elephant, these works have drawn attention to different aspects of a broader phenomenon. How EO as a multifaceted organizational attribute shapes future scholarly dialogue is discussed.

This paper describes three principal ways entrepreneurship-as-an-organizational attribute has been discussed, including illustrative examples from real-world businesses. One perspective recognizes the entrepreneurial aspect of organizations by considering top management style; a second perspective recognizes that organizations manifest entrepreneurship through a configuration of key organizational elements; and a third perspective looks to evidence of the organization's entry into new offerings and domains of operation as indicative of entrepreneurship. All three manifestations of \u201cbeing entrepreneurial\u201d are part of the current conversation on EO.

Nonetheless, the equity crowdfunding market is still relatively under researched. The purpose of this paper is to explore how contingency factors combine and causally connect in leading to possible success or failure in equity crowdfunding rounds. To reach this goal, a configurational approach was chosen. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a suitable method for this topic because of its ability to identify and assess different combinations of conditions that explain certain outcomes. The paper uses the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine the casual configurations of 344 projects posted on the leading UK crowdinvesting platform (Crowdcube) from March 2016 to the beginning of November 2017. Six antecedent conditions capable of positively or negatively influencing the outcome of an equity crowdfunding campaign were identified through a review of the literature. Four refer to the firm (firm age, industry sector, number of founders or CEOs, and founder or CEO gender) and two relate to the funding round (presence of rewards and number of pictures). The configurational analysis reveals that crowdfunding success and failure are associated with different combinations of conditions. Moreover, multiple configurations of these conditions are associated with both crowdfunding success and failure. However, for each of the crowdfunding outcomes \u2013 success and failure \u2013 there is a single combination of conditions that is clearly superior to the other configurations in accounting for the observed outcome. Among the sampled firms, crowdfunding was found to be successful for start-ups with a large number of founders and numerous pictures.

Whereas the majority of research in this vein involves financial performance, we apply this framework to product quality performance, arguing that when performance diverges either below or above aspirations, firms will pursue a slower subsequent product introduction rate, either to identify the cause of the underperformance or to incorporate the successful product characteristics in the case of overperformance. We also investigate whether our predictions hold when two boundary conditions are applied.

Best considered under the rubric of corporate entrepreneurship, EO deals with the origination and implementation of strategic behaviors that are entrepreneurial in nature: developing and launching novel products and services (innovativeness); entering new markets and preempting others in the pursuit of new business opportunities (proactiveness); and committing organizational resources towards uncertain ends (risk-taking) (Covin and Slevin, 1991). Additional categories of behavior often considered elements of EO include competitive aggressiveness (whereby the firm actively engages its rivals) and autonomy (whereby the freedom exists within firms for individuals to exercise their discretion in the pursuit of opportunities) (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). EO is a firm-level construct, observable through the behavioral manifestations of organizational strategy (Covin and Lumpkin, 2011); thus, we know a firm is entrepreneurial because it engages in various behaviors that place the firm in novel product-market domains (Covin and Slevin, 1991; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996). What makes EO a compelling topic for entrepreneurship scholars is that, while debates abound over EO\u2019s ontological and epistemological construction, it is clearly tapping a theoretically rich and meaningful phenomenon. At its most basic level, EO deals directly with the question of how we identify entrepreneurial firms, and more broadly, what the mechanisms are that facilitate entrepreneurial behaviors and then, what the consequences are of those behaviors.", "aggregation_type": "Book", "subtype": "ch", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36599817700", "authid": "36599817700", "authname": "Anderson B.S.", "surname": "Anderson", "given-name": "Brian S.", "initials": "B.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60093261"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

A recent Accenture survey of more than 500 executives revealed that over 50% report a poor innovation process, while fewer than 18% believe their own innovation strategy provides a competitive advantage for the firm. While many causal reasons can be offered, our research on corporate entrepreneurship and innovation demonstrates there are four key implementation issues that most corporations are not recognizing or responding to effectively. Effective recognition of and response to these four implementation issues may represent the difference between those companies that create a successful corporate innovation strategy and those that do not. The four issues are: (1) understanding what type of innovation is being sought, (2) coordinating managerial roles, (3) effectively using operating controls, and (4) properly training and preparing individuals. Together, these four issues-if understood and appropriately addressed-help create an effective innovative ecosystem within the organization. \u00a9 2014 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003407422", "authid": "7003407422", "authname": "Hornsby J.S.", "surname": "Hornsby", "given-name": "Jeffrey S.", "initials": "J.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007056"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

As research on corporate entrepreneurial activity has evolved, numerous researchers have acknowledged the importance of internal organizational dimensions to promoting and supporting an environment for innovation. This research has identified five specific dimensions that are important determinants of an environment conducive to entrepreneurial behavior: (1) top management support, (2) work discretion/autonomy, (3) rewards/reinforcement, (4) time availability, and (5) organizational boundaries. If an organization is serious about developing an internal environment conducive to entrepreneurial activity, then it must seek to measure the specific dimensions associated with an innovative environment. In this article we introduce an instrument, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI), as a diagnostic tool used for assessing managers' perceptions of the five major dimensions critical to creating an entrepreneurial/innovative environment.

In doing so, this study examines organizational and industry factors that impact the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth and proposes that this main effect relationship will be curvilinear (inverted U shaped). Further, this study hypothesizes that an organization's ability to strategically learn will positively moderate the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth. Additionally, this study hypothesizes that the greater the technological sophistication of the industry, the more positive the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth. Hierarchical regression analysis was utilized to examine the hypotheses as observed within a grouping of 101 select firms. Findings indicate that all hypotheses are supported, except for that regarding strategic learning, which is shown to negatively moderate the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth.

Although we observe that research is vibrant in these traditional areas, we also argue that the continued revitalization of the field of entrepreneurship can be fostered through examining opportunities for research in areas such as industry change and competition, inter-organizational cooperation (which has proliferated more recently), university-sponsored entrepreneurship, venture finance, institutional differences that foster entrepreneurship (primarily between different countries), and appropriability regime differences (including legal and regulatory frameworks) that foster entrepreneurial activities and profit appropriation. Besides pointing scholars to new promising directions, we argue for more attention to the transformational role of entrepreneurship itself by issuing a call for more multi-level research efforts that connect the micro- and macro-foundations of entrepreneurship and explore the revitalization-related uncertainties such as the cost of creating an entrepreneurial orientation and whether there is an optimal level. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

However, the association between manufacturing capabilities and firm performance has seldom been studied in the context of high technology new ventures. Using a sample of 167 UK-based, high technology manufacturing ventures, the current study examines the relationship between manufacturing capabilities (in particular, those contributing to low operating costs and product quality) and venture performance. Additionally, the moderating effects of the ventures' alliance portfolios and environmental contexts on the capability-performance relationships are explored. Results indicate that venture performance (as reflected in sales growth, return on sales (ROS), and return on assets (ROA)) is significantly predicted by manufacturing capabilities that promote low operating costs and product quality. Further, the data generally support the hypothesized moderating effects of two alliance diversity variables (alliance partner diversity and alliance geographic diversity) and two environmental context variables (environmental dynamism and environmental munificence) on the capability-performance relationships. Overall, the study supports the premise that the value of manufacturing capabilities (i.e., the strength of the capability-performance relationship) among high technology ventures is contingent upon the alliance and environmental contexts within which those ventures operate. Specifically, alliance partner diversity, alliance geographic diversity, and environmental munificence enhance the value of manufacturing capabilities that promote low operating costs. Alliance partner diversity, environmental munificence, and environmental stability enhance the value of manufacturing capabilities that promote product quality.

Likewise, growing evidence suggests that effective operations control is a common quality of successful firms. On the surface the two phenomena - corporate entrepreneurship and operations control - may seem to be inherently at odds. That is, corporate entrepreneurship is aimed at taking the firm in new directions, while operations control is aimed at channeling and often restricting actions. As such, it would be useful to know how operations control variables act in concert with the determinants of corporate entrepreneurial activity to promote the innovation outcomes that facilitate long-term organizational success. In this study of 177 firms operating in a wide variety of industries, we investigate the effect on innovation performance of several commonly-acknowledged antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship, as measured by the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (e.g., Hornsby et al., 2008, 2002); namely, management support, work discretion/autonomy, rewards/reinforcements, time availability, and organizational boundaries. More importantly, we examine the moderating effects of operations control variables - specifically risk control and process control formality - on the relationships between the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance. Results indicate that only two of the five antecedents to corporate entrepreneurship have main effects on innovation performance with moderate significance. However, each of the five antecedents significantly interacts with one or both of the operations control variables and, thereby, influences innovation performance. The implications of these results in relation to operations management and corporate entrepreneurship theory and practice are discussed. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603934583", "authid": "6603934583", "authname": "Goodale J.C.", "surname": "Goodale", "given-name": "John C.", "initials": "J.C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029472"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003407422", "authid": "7003407422", "authname": "Hornsby J.S.", "surname": "Hornsby", "given-name": "Jeffrey S.", "initials": "J.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138813"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

Learning capability is conceptualized in the current research as a firm's ability to develop or acquire the new knowledge-based resources and skills needed to offer new products. Industry technological parity is conceptualized as the extent to which similarity and equality exist among the technological competencies of the firms in an industry. Three generic modes of innovation are considered: internal, cooperative, and external innovation. These modes reflect the development of new products based solely on internal resources, the collaborative development of new products (i.e., with one or more development partners), and the acquisition of fully developed products from external sources, respectively. The premises of this research are that (1) technological parity can create incentives or disincentives for innovating in a particular mode, depending upon the value of external innovative resources relative to the value of internal innovative resources and (2) firms will choose innovation modes that reflect a combination of their abilities and incentives to innovate alone, with others, or through others. Survey research and secondary sources were used to collect data from 119 high-technology firms. Results indicate that firms exhibit greater use of internal and external innovation when high levels of industry technological parity are matched by high levels of firm learning capability. By contrast, a negative relationship between learning capability and industry technological parity is associated with greater use of the cooperative mode of innovation. Thus, a single, common internal capability - learning capability - interacts with the level of technological parity in the environment to significantly predict three distinct innovation modes - modes that are not inherently dependent upon one another. As such, a firm's internal ability to innovate, as reflected in learning capability, has relevance well beyond that firm's likely internal innovation output. It also predicts the firm's likely use of cooperative and external innovation when considered in light of the level of industry technological parity. A practical implication of these findings is that companies with modest learning capabilities are not inherently precluded from innovating. Rather, they can innovate through modes for which conditions in their current environments do not constitute significant obstacles to innovation output. In particular, modest learning capabilities are associated with higher innovative output in the internal, cooperative, and external modes when industry technological parity levels are low, high, and low, respectively. Conversely, strong learning capabilities tend to be associated with higher innovative output in the internal, cooperative, and external modes when industry technological parity levels are high, low, and high, respectively. \u00a9 2009 Product Development & Management Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36808418200", "authid": "36808418200", "authname": "Hull C.E.", "surname": "Hull", "given-name": "Clyde Eir\u00edkur", "initials": "C.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116152"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

Moderated regression analysis based on data collected from 111 manufacturing firms supports the hypotheses. Top management risk taking and market responsiveness positively predict the use of a pioneering strategy.

However, technological knowledge is not accumulated solely through internal learning processes. Increasingly, firms are turning to external sources in the technology supply chain to acquire the technological knowledge they need to introduce product and process innovations. Thus, the successful structuring and executing of partnerships with external \"technology source\" organizations is often critical to competitive success in technologically dynamic environments. This study uses situated learning theory as a basis for explaining how factors inherent to the knowledge acquisition context may affect the successful transference of technological knowledge from universities to their industry partners. Data collected via a survey instrument from 104 industry managers were used to explore the effects of various organizational knowledge interface factors on knowledge acquisition success in university-industry alliances. The organizational knowledge interface factors hypothesized to affect knowledge acquisition success in the current research include partner trust, partner familiarity, technology familiarity, alliance experience, formal collaboration teams, and technology experts' communications. Results indicate that partner trust predicts the successful acquisition of tacit knowledge but not explicit knowledge. Both forms of knowledge are predicted by partner familiarity and communications between the partners' technology experts. These findings suggest three principal managerial implications. First, although the development of a trusting relationship between the knowledge source and knowledge-seeking parties is generally advisable, firms that seek to acquire explicit technological knowledge from their alliance partners may successfully do so without having made significant time and energy investments designed to assure themselves that they can trust those partners. The relative observability and verifiability of explicit knowledge relative to tacit knowledge may enable knowledge-seeking parties to have greater confidence that knowledge has been acquired when partner trust is in question or has not been deliberately developed. A second implication is that, other things being equal, a knowledge-seeking party's interests may be best served through repeated exposures to particular alliance partners, particularly if those exposures facilitate mutual understandings on relevant process-related matters. A third managerial implication is that ongoing, broad-based communications between the partners' technology experts should be used to effect technology transfer. A key quality of the organizational knowledge interface that promotes the successful acquisition of technological knowledge, both tacit and explicit, is multipoint, real-time contact between the technology experts of the partner organizations. Such communications potentially enable the knowledge-seeking party to directly access desired information through the most knowledgeable individuals on an as-needed basis. \u00a9 2008 Product Development & Management Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23482932200", "authid": "23482932200", "authname": "Sherwood A.L.", "surname": "Sherwood", "given-name": "Arthur Lloyd", "initials": "A.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008599"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008599"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

The exhibition of strategic adaptability - the ability of a firm to alter its alignment with the environment through reactive and proactive behaviors (Evans, 1991) - is a function of the goodness-of-fit that exists between the capabilities of a firm and the demands imposed by its relevant industry context (Burgelman & Grove, 1996). When firm capabilities are well aligned with industry success factors, those capabilities constitute strategic assets for the firm, or resources that lead to the achievement of competitive success in that context (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993). The possession of strategic assets thus contributes to a state of adaptation, defined by Chakravarthy (1982) as a state in which an organization exhibits the capacity to survive the conditions of its changing environment. Because of the constantly shifting nature of the environment, a state of adaptation is not a permanent settling point for the organization, but rather a moving target for the organization as it attempts to remain \"mapped on\" to the exigencies of the environment. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

That is, certain types of environments may be most likely to encourage or reward the actions of pioneers, while these same actions may meet with limited success in other environments. Second, theory and past research suggest that firm performance is affected by the fit between a firm's pioneer/follower status and its competitive tactics. In other words, market entry order moderates the effectiveness of a firm's competitive tactics such that certain tactics will be most effective when employed by market pioneers, while other tactics will be most effective when employed by market followers. Considered jointly, the preceding observations suggest that insights might be gained regarding the effective management of market pioneering and market following by seeking to understand (a) how these phenomena are manifested in different industry environments and (b) what pioneers and followers do differently in these environments to promote their performance. The research described in this paper addresses these issues. In particular, this paper develops theory that describes how particular competitive tactics are thought to relate to firm sales growth rate among market pioneers and market followers in two distinct environmental settings. Hypotheses are developed based on the following research propositions: P1: In hostile environments, pioneers and followers will differentially benefit in achieving high sales growth rates from their reliance on relatively high prices, relatively broad product lines, relatively broad served (geographical) markets, relatively advanced process technologies, and relatively advantageous purchasing arrangements. P2: In benign environments, pioneers and followers will differentially benefit in achieving high sales growth rates from their reliance on relatively high quality products, relatively strong product warranties, relatively high advertising and promotion expenditures, relatively strong control over distribution channels employed, and relatively large numbers of distribution channels employed. To test the hypothesized relationships, data were collected from the senior managers of 103 independent, nondiversified manufacturing firms operating in 75 industries. Cluster analysis, ANOVA, and correlational analysis were employed as the principal analytical techniques. The results suggest that market pioneers grow neither more nor less rapidly than market followers. However, in hostile environments, pioneering may enable firms to break out of the dominant price-based mode of competition and grow in spite of charging high prices. This ability of pioneers to excel in hostile environments seems to be further facilitated by limiting product line breath to a small number of product offerings that provide a \"tight fit\" with market needs. Pioneers in hostile environments also appear to be relatively better served than followers from gaining a wide geographical distribution for their products. Followers in hostile environments, on the other hand, should seek to reduce their cost structures in order to effectively sustain low price strategies. The employment of advanced process technologies and the pursuit of \"purchasing advantages\" were actions which proved to be more advantageous for followers than for pioneers in hostile environments. The managerial implications of this research applicable to benign environment firms are quite different. Other things being equal, relatively high prices may not be as detrimental to growth among followers in benign environments as they are among followers in more hostile environments. Benign environment followers may, in fact, be better off when they charge relatively high prices and compete on non-price bases. The results also suggest that, in benign environments, offering products with warranties superior to those of competitors may have a significantly more positive effect on sales growth among pioneers than followers. Moreover, employing a large number of distribution channels appears to benefit pioneers more than followers. However, among the sampled firms, benign environment pioneers that realized the greatest growth did not have extensive control over distribution channel members. Therefore, benign environment pioneers may grow more quickly if they target their distribution-related resources toward expanding their channels rather than toward controlling some smaller number these channels. This study contributes to the pioneering literature by having corroborated several findings of the PIMS-based studies regarding tactical differences between pioneers and followers, and by having further documented the relevance of market entry order (or pioneer/follower status) as a moderator of the performance associated with particular competitive tactics. Moreover, by having examined the tactics-performance relationships of pioneers and followers in two distinct environmental settings, this study adds specificity and empirical support to the emerging theoretical paradigm that depicts pioneering as an environment-specific phenomenon. Finally, this study contributes to the literature on coping with hostility by having theorized about and empirically identified common and effective bases for competition under varying levels of environmental hostility. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "101518725"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603094038", "authid": "6603094038", "authname": "Slevin D.P.", "surname": "Slevin", "given-name": "Dennis P.", "initials": "D.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015543"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602382463", "authid": "6602382463", "authname": "Heeley M.B.", "surname": "Heeley", "given-name": "Michael B.", "initials": "M.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "101518725"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

For the most part, the call for greater entrepreneurial behavior on the part of established companies has been accepted on faith as an inherently desirable objective. The implicit logic behind the pervasive belief in the value of corporate entrepreneurship seems to be that risk taking, innovation, and aggressive competitive action-the key elements of entrepreneurial corporations-will help in identifying and pursuing lucrative product/market opportunities and in providing new bases for achieving superior competitive positions. But what do we really know about the financial consequences of corporate entrepreneurship? Most of the evidence that corporate entrepreneurship \"pays off\" is anecdotal in nature or based on cross-sectional studies that focus on the short-term implications of entrepreneurial behaviors. As such, in a definitive sense, we know very little about the financial consequences of corporate entrepreneurship. In an attempt to improve our understanding of this issue, this article describes a study of corporate entrepreneurship and its impact on company financial performance. Data were collected from three different samples over a seven-year period to assess the longitudinal impact of corporate entrepreneurship on firm performance. These samples consist of 24 medium-sized manufacturing firms representing 14 industry segments, 39 chemical companies, and 45 Fortune 500 industrial firms representing five industry segments. Data were gathered on each sample using both primary and secondary sources. Regression analysis was then used to analyze the data. The results suggest that corporate entrepreneurship has a positive impact on financial measures of company performance. This effect on performance, which tends to be modest over the first few years, increases over time, suggesting that corporate entrepreneurship may, indeed, be a generally effective means for improving long-term company financial performance. Moreover, the results indicate that corporate entrepreneurship is a particularly effective practice among companies operating in hostile environments (as opposed to benign environments). The study has three principal implications for practicing managers. First, the study documents the general financial viability of engaging in corporate entrepreneurship. This is not to suggest that corporate entrepreneurship is a panacea for improving financial performance. However, entrepreneurial behavior, when considered on the whole (i.e., across firms and industries), is associated with superior financial performance. Second, the study suggests a need to use a long-term time horizon in order to adequately judge the financial consequences of corporate entrepreneurship. The use of a shorter evaluation period may not allow sufficient time for entrepreneurial actions to have their full market and corresponding financial impact. Finally, the study identifies the context-specific character of effective entrepreneurial practice. Specifically, corporate entrepreneurship appears to be a particularly effective strategic practice among firms operating in hostile business settings. \u00a9 1995.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003264340", "authid": "7003264340", "authname": "Zahra S.", "surname": "Zahra", "given-name": "Shaker A.", "initials": "S.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012387"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

Strategic posture was conceptualized as a firm's placement along the conservative-entrepreneurial continuum. Structural form was conceptualized as a firm's placement along the organic-mechanistic continuum. Managers' ratings on several financial performance criteria were used to assess new venture performance. Four hypotheses were tested in this study: H1 Strategic posture varies among new ventures in different industry life cycle stages. New ventures in emerging industries have the most entrepreneurial strategic postures. H2 The correlation between a firm's strategic posture score (i.e., its entrepreneurship level) and its performance is significantly more positive for new ventures in emerging industries than it is for new ventures in mature industries. H3 Organization structure varies among new ventures in different industry life cycle stages. New ventures in emerging industries have the most organic organization structures. H4 The correlation between a firm's organization structure score (i.e., its organicity level) and its performance is significantly more positive for new ventures in emerging industries than it is for new ventures in mature industries. Data were collected from the senior executives in 90 new ventures. These ventures were classified as existing in either emerging industries (n = 26), growing industries (n = 25), or mature industries (n = 39) according to their scores on a product/industry life cycle measure. Discriminant and correlation analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Consistent with hypotheses 1 and 3, results indicate that strategic posture and organization structure vary significantly over the industry life cycle and that new ventures in emerging industries have both the most entrepreneurial strategic postures and the most organic organization structures. Furthermore, the industry life cycle was found to moderate the strength of the relationship between new venture performance and both strategic posture and organization structure. Consistent with hypotheses 2 and 4, the correlations between a firm's performance and its strategic posture and organicity scores were significantly more positive among new ventures in emerging industries than among new ventures in mature industries. These results suggest that new venture performance is influenced by the fit between strategic posture, organization structure, and industry life cycle stage. Entrepreneurial strategic postures and organic organization structures appear to be most effective for new ventures in emerging industries and, accordingly, should be seriously considered by managers operating in these settings. High performance in growing industries is also generally associated with organic structural forms; however, the efficacy of entrepreneurial behaviors is appreciably less than in emerging industries. Managers in growing industries should create organic organization structures but be more cautious in adopting entrepreneurial strategic postures. Mature industries call for more mechanistic structures, and structural attributes designed to promote operating efficiency (e.g., standardization of operations, formal control mechanisms) are suggested for effective management. Entrepreneurial behaviors do not appear to be strongly related to new venture performance in mature industries, although individual cases and situations may vary. \u00a9 1990.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603094038", "authid": "6603094038", "authname": "Slevin D.", "surname": "Slevin", "given-name": "Dennis P.", "initials": "D.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015543"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

Yet little help exists in the academic literature in terms of identification of specific business practices and competitive tactics associated with the pursuit of market share growth. Rather, most discussion of appropriate strategies for small firm growth centers around the prescription of broad strategy types (e.g., the often recommended niche strat- egy). Furthermore, the environment's potential effects on the viability of growth strategies seldom receive adequate treatment in the small firm strategy literature despite the long-acknowledged influence of environmental conditions on strategy content. This paper describes a study of the business strategies used by small, growth-seeking firms in high- and low-technology industries. The construct of strategy was examined from both a micro level, focusing on individual strategy dimensions, and a macro level, focusing on the firms' overall strategic postures and patterns of strategy-related variables. Data were collected from the senior executives of 57 small manufacturing firms whose mission strategies were to aggressively increase sales and market share. The data indicate that growth-seeking firms in high-technology industries, relative to those in low-technology industries, (1) rely more heavily on advertising, (2) place more emphasis on product-related issues (e.g., new product development, superior product warranties) as a basis for building market share, (3) rely more heavily on formal planning activities, (4) place more emphasis on customer service/support, (5) rely more heavily on external financing, (6) rely more heavily on premium pricing strategies, and (7) have more entrepreneurial strategic postures. The data also indicate that an entrepreneurial strategic posture is more positively associated with firm performance among growth-seeking firms in low-tech industries than among those in high-tech industries, although there are exceptions to this finding. Cluster analysis was used to identify the content and performance of various strategies (operationally defined as patterns of strategic variables) associated with growth-seeking firms in high- and low-technology industries. Four strategies were identified through this technique - two of which are most common among firms in low-tech industries, one of which is most common among firms in high-tech industries, and one of which is equally prevalent in both industry types. These results corroborate several of the aforementioned findings regarding the effects of industry technological sophistication on dimensions of firm strategy. For example, they demonstrate the general aversion among growth-seeking firms in low-tech industries to premium pricing. Furthermore, they suggest that, overall, growth-seeking firms in low-tech industries may be somewhat more disposed to pursuing cost-leadership strategies and less disposed to pursuing differentiation strategies than growth-seeking firms in high-tech industries. There were no overall performance differences across the four strategy types identified through the cluster analysis. However, the data suggest that an entrepreneurial strategic posture is most strongly associated with high performance among firms that have a cohesive and focused strategic mix or pattern of strategic decisions. This finding holds for growth-seeking firms in both industry types. \u00a9 1990.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603094038", "authid": "6603094038", "authname": "Slevin D.", "surname": "Slevin", "given-name": "Dennis P.", "initials": "D.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015543"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602731755", "authid": "6602731755", "authname": "Covin T.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Teresa Joyce", "initials": "T.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019740"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

Meanwhile, management practitioners frequently ignore such general rules, because they are convinced that their particular projects pose entirely unique kinds of problems. This study, based on 408 responses to an extensive questionnaire, explores managerial perceptions about project characteristics. For this purpose, we chose two types of projects apparently lying at opposite ends of a spectrum of characteristics-construction and R&D. We were interested additionally in whether factors considered crucial to successful execution varied over the life cycles of projects. The findings suggest that while some critical success factors appear to be common to both types of projects, there also exist significant differences; and, furthermore, that these factors tend to vary with stages in the life cycle. We conclude that practitioners may derive benefit from paying attention to normative project-management theory, but that theoreticians must also descend from the level of broad generalizations to take into account the peculiarities of various classes of projects. \u00a9 1989.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402584749", "authid": "7402584749", "authname": "Pinto J.K.", "surname": "Pinto", "given-name": "Jeffrey K.", "initials": "J.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008279"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116662"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602113346"}

This approach has been represented more recently in Ronen and Shenkar\u2019s (2013) 11 clusters of country cultures. However, more contemporary research found within-country heterogeneity of values/behaviors is substantial and growing exponentially across today\u2019s twenty-first century businessworld. We investigated, across a sample of 39 societies, whether work values variance within societies was greater than work values variance across societies, and whether individual work values differences contributed more to predictions of behavioral performance criteria than the society in which the individuals lived. Both sets of analyses addressed how work values conceived at societal-levels are relevant in understanding the twenty-first century businessworld. Our findings revealed first that there was substantial within-society values heterogeneity, which resulted in the failure to replicate Ronen and Shanker\u2019s (2013) societal cluster aggregations. Second, we found individual-level values contributed significantly to the prediction of employees\u2019 behaviors, while societal-level values contributed substantially less. These findings strongly suggest that cross-cultural studies of work values predictive power are most relevant when conducted at the individual-level. Finally, we also make available for future investigators a 51-society database containing 11,780 individual-level records.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true",

The confusion is rooted, in part, in the dominance of normative perspectives that take RL as a universal phenomenon. However, embedded in a specific culture, RL cannot be understood fully without understanding the moral traditions of that culture. In this article, we used a case study method to explore how RL is understood and practiced in China. Taking the role theory perspective, we conducted in-depth interviews with 9 highly regarded responsible executive leaders and 92 stakeholders in and outside of their companies who were well acquainted with the leaders. Our findings reveal that in China, the moral character of leaders guides them to define and take responsibility for themselves, their employees, companies, and external stakeholders. The five dimensions of RL we identified and the relationships among the dimensions include characteristics that reflect Chinese culture, such as strong sentiment for the nation, self-discipline, developing employees philosophically, and \u2018jun zi wu ben\u2019 (a gentleman should focus on fundamental matters).

Drawing on the resource management perspective, we predict that androgynous individuals will report the highest subjective career success, followed by masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated individuals. We also postulate that meso-organizational culture and macro-societal values will have moderating effects on gender role's impact on subjective career success. The results of our hierarchical linear models support the hypothesized hierarchy of the relationships between gender-role-orientations and subjective career success. However, we found that ethical achievement values at the societal culture level was the only variable that had a positive moderating impact on the relationship between feminine orientation and subjective career success. Thus, our findings of minimal moderation effect suggest that meso- and macro-level environments may not play a significant role in determining an individual's perception of career success.",

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use case studies of three exemplary humanistic leaders and the companies they lead to describe their leadership practices and influence on others and their companies. Findings: The authors identify three common elements that connect their observations to an emerging scholarly conceptualization of humanistic leadership and develop a framework of Confucian humanistic leadership consisting of five attributes. The cases the authors studied suggest that the five attributes should be understood as being mutually reinforcing and acting in concert, rather than each acting independently of the others. The authors found that there is inherent consistency and connection between the core values of Confucianism and humanistic leadership. Originality/value: The research contributes to the leadership literature, specifically the emerging literature on humanistic leadership, by introducing a framework for Confucian humanistic leadership. While much of the extant literature on humanistic leadership has been conceptual, the study shows how it is possible to practice humanistic leadership in the Chinese context by drawing on the foundation provided by Confucian humanistic philosophy.

In response to recent research suggesting that emotions may be the key to ethical decision making, we ask two basic questions: Do emotions make business students more ethical? Is business school education inhibiting ethical decision making? Drawing on theories on moral emotions and ethical decision making, we hypothesize that moral emotions will enhance ethical decision making, whereas hedonic emotions will diminish ethical decision making. Furthermore, we predict that a higher level of business school education will strengthen the negative relationship between hedonic emotions and ethical decision making while weakening the positive relationship between moral emotions and ethical decision making. Using a scenario-based repeated-measure design, we tested our hypotheses with 217 students from secondary schools, undergraduate business majors, and MBA programs in Hong Kong. Multilevel modeling results supported our hypotheses, suggesting that business school students may benefit from education on the unique roles of moral and hedonic emotions in the ethical decision-making process.

The authors developed hypotheses to test the mediating effects of three types of perception in the relationship between an assertive influence strategy and five outcomes, and additional analyses on persuasive and relational influence strategies are also conducted. Findings: Results show that when subordinates attribute the cause to their ability (internal attribution), an assertive influence has indirect positive effect on felt obligation, organizational commitment, job performance and organizational citizenship behavior; when subordinates attribute the cause to the poor relationship with their superiors (relational attribution), an assertive influence has indirect negative impact on most outcomes except for job performance; when subordinates perceive that the cause is to the superiors, such as authoritarian leadership (external attribution), an assertive influence has indirect positive effect on job performance.

The emphasis is on the common-alities and differences between these women and women entrepreneurs in Western developed countries as reflected in the literature. Research Design & Methods: The study was designed to include both qualitative and quantitative data to allow better understanding of the topic. Interviews with foreign women entrepreneurs were first done to gain practical field insights which were then used with the information from the literature to develop the questionnaire for the survey for quantitative data. Findings: The findings from the interviews and the survey from a very small sample show the key differences lie in internal factors like motivation and family-business orientation, but there are also similarities in terms of external characteristics, such as business nature, business size, financing source, etc. between foreign female entrepreneurs in China and those represented in studies. And the key challenges and learning reported by foreign female entrepreneurs in China are both related to culture. Implications & Recommendations: The article intends to fill the gap by offering some insights into foreign women entrepreneurs in China. Broader and in-depth empirical studies on this subject are needed to verify these initial findings, and stimulate interests in this important but neglected field.

Also, at Time 2, mid-level managers evaluated their relationship with the organization in terms of economic and social exchange. HLM was used to analyze the data. Findings \u2013 The authors found the positive relationship between transactional CEO leader behaviors and mid-level manager in-role behaviors to be enhanced when CEOs hold self-transcendent values, whereas this relationship was weakened by CEO self-enhancing values. Similarly, the relationship between CEO transformational leader behaviors and mid-level manager OCBs was found to be strengthened when leaders espoused self-transcendent values. Finally, the authors found that economic exchange mediated the relationship between the transactional leadership * self-enhancing values interaction term and mid-level manager in-role behaviors.

To capture both the evolution and expression of leader traits, we propose a dynamic model. We argue that the evolution of traits consists of changes in intensity and nature. Based on data on five publicly acknowledged Chinese leaders collected from various sources, we identified three patterns (homological, converse, and composite) by which leader traits evolve. We also discovered that leader's traits can be intrinsic or extrinsic. The intrinsic traits change in intensity; whereas the extrinsic traits are replaced by other traits over time. Factors influencing these changes include both internal (e.g., leaders' own learning and introspection) and external (e.g., major social events and subtle cultural influences).

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a comprehensive review of suzhi literature, Chinese cultural and historical literature, as well as Western mainstream HRM research, a multidimensional suzhi framework is conceptualized. Findings - As an indigenous expression, suzhi can be and has been adopted for Chinese HRM research and practice. As a multidimensional construct, one's cognitive suzhi is jointly determined by corresponding moral suzhi, wenhua (knowledge-based) suzhi and zhuanye (professional) suzhi. Cognitive suzhi, in turn, determines one's behavioral suzhi that drives employees to enhance organizational performance, and this relationship is moderated by psychological suzhi. Research limitations/implications - The proposed framework provides new insight for Chinese indigenous management research, particularly in developing suzhi measurement for different dimensions. It also informs HRM practices in recruiting, selection, performance analysis and employee career development. Originality/value - The complexity of suzhi dimensions from an organizational HRM perspective is analyzed. The resulting suzhi framework offers new insight for HRM research and practices in China.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56142333100", "authid": "56142333100", "authname": "Xu L.", "surname": "Xu", "given-name": "Liguo", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018308"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Pinging", "initials": "P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55627940600", "authid": "55627940600", "authname": "Xi Y.", "surname": "Xi", "given-name": "Youmin", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018308"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60102426"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

In this study, the authors examine the moderating effect of middle managers' traditionality, a within-culture value orientation regarding submission to authority and endorsement of hierarchical role relationships, on their responses to an organization's employee-organization relationship practices. Based on social learning and social exchange theories, the authors expect the more traditional middle managers to respond less positively in terms of their performance and commitment to high levels of expected contributions and the associated psychological empowerment but respond more positively to high levels of offered inducements. Using a sample of 535 middle managers from 40 companies in China, the authors find support for all hypotheses except the moderating effect of traditionality on the relationship between offered inducements and performance. Additional analysis reveals that less-traditional managers responded to economic rewards (but not developmental rewards) with higher job performance. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for research and the practice of employment relationships. \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56032559600", "authid": "56032559600", "authname": "Zhang A.Y.", "surname": "Zhang", "given-name": "Ann Yan", "initials": "A.Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014966"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15837793800", "authid": "15837793800", "authname": "Song L.J.", "surname": "Song", "given-name": "Lynda Jiwen", "initials": "L.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006812715", "authid": "7006812715", "authname": "Tsui A.S.", "surname": "Tsui", "given-name": "Anne S.", "initials": "A.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003892"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014966"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60009860"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

Or are individual-level analyses more appropriate for assessing the influence of values on ethical behaviors across country workforces? Using multi-level analyses for a 48-society sample, we test the utility of both the societal-level and individual-level dimensions of collectivism and individualism values for predicting ethical behaviors of business professionals. Our values-based behavioral analysis indicates that values at the individual-level make a more significant contribution to explaining variance in ethical behaviors than do values at the societal-level. Implicitly, our findings question the soundness of using societal-level values measures.

This paper argues that supervisors who consistently use socio-emotional and supportive influence strategies are likely to enhance subordinates' immediate commitment to the tasks as well as their psychological attachment to the organization. Drawing on the transactional-relational contracts framework, we develop and empirically examine the effects of supervisors' influence behaviors on two types of commitment. Data collected from 1150 respondents from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany, United States and Brazil provided support for the positive relationship between the persuasive influence strategy and both immediate task and organizational commitment. Exploratory analyses of the cultural differences in our sample reveal differences in assertive and relationship-based individual tactics. We thus identified potentially universally endorsed as well as culturally contingent influence tactics in predicting the two types of commitment. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25521146500", "authid": "25521146500", "authname": "Chong M.P.M.", "surname": "Chong", "given-name": "Melody P.M.", "initials": "M.P.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013983"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36144315400", "authid": "36144315400", "authname": "Muethel M.", "surname": "Muethel", "given-name": "Miriam", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012481"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402054665", "authid": "7402054665", "authname": "Richards M.", "surname": "Richards", "given-name": "Malika", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60073787"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25026304800", "authid": "25026304800", "authname": "Peng T.K.", "surname": "Peng", "given-name": "Tai Kuang", "initials": "T.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60024908"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55376233600", "authid": "55376233600", "authname": "Shang Y.F.", "surname": "Shang", "given-name": "Yu Fan", "initials": "Y.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018308"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005308035", "authid": "7005308035", "authname": "Caldas M.P.", "surname": "Caldas", "given-name": "Miguel P.", "initials": "M.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60069326"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

We also expand and use the crossvergence model to examine the cross-level relationship between socio-cultural (i. e., traditional/secular; survival/self-expression; in-group favoritism) and business ideology influences (i. e., human development level, control of corruption) on perceptions of favor-seeking at work. This study examines the perceptions of a total of 4,325 managers and professionals in a diverse set of 11 Asian societies: China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Our investigation focuses on both the \"softer\" (image management) and \"harder\" (self-serving) sides of subordinate influence attempts to seek favors, as well as the degree of ethical differentiation across these societies. Key results based on hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) suggest that both the World Value Survey's socio-cultural values as well as in-group favoritism contribute to our understanding of influence behaviors in Asia. Likewise, level of human development and control of corruption also appear to be promising predictors of influence ethics. In sum, our results suggest that widening the scope of the crossvergence conceptualization of socio-cultural and business ideology influences engender a better understanding of differences in attitudes toward subordinate use of favoritism across Asian societies. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23984979400", "authid": "23984979400", "authname": "Karam C.M.", "surname": "Karam", "given-name": "Charlotte M.", "initials": "C.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60068761"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005025369", "authid": "7005025369", "authname": "Ralston D.A.", "surname": "Ralston", "given-name": "David A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015206"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602228740", "authid": "6602228740", "authname": "Egri C.P.", "surname": "Egri", "given-name": "Carolyn P.", "initials": "C.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018491"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8539696900", "authid": "8539696900", "authname": "Butt A.", "surname": "Butt", "given-name": "Arif", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60042311"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102494265", "authid": "7102494265", "authname": "Srinivasan N.", "surname": "Srinivasan", "given-name": "Narasimhan", "initials": "N.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022659"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8564382100", "authid": "8564382100", "authname": "Lee C.H.", "surname": "Lee", "given-name": "Chay Hoon", "initials": "C.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60005510"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26324686200", "authid": "26324686200", "authname": "Moon Y.l.", "surname": "Moon", "given-name": "Yong lin", "initials": "Y.l.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013682"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24179167100", "authid": "24179167100", "authname": "Li Y.", "surname": "Li", "given-name": "Yongjuan", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019499"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "10", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202390880", "authid": "7202390880", "authname": "Ansari M.", "surname": "Ansari", "given-name": "Mahfooz", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60024776"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "11", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57145753700", "authid": "57145753700", "authname": "Kuo C.", "surname": "Kuo", "given-name": "Christine", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013395"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "12", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53986266100", "authid": "53986266100", "authname": "Hung V.T.", "surname": "Hung", "given-name": "Vu Thanh", "initials": "V.T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60071407"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "13", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/11241252700", "authid": "11241252700", "authname": "Pekerti A.", "surname": "Pekerti", "given-name": "Andre", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60031004"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "14", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197920356", "authid": "57197920356", "authname": "Hallinger P.", "surname": "Hallinger", "given-name": "Philip", "initials": "P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "113216352"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "15", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58386753200", "authid": "58386753200", "authname": "Fang Y.", "surname": "Fang", "given-name": "Yongqing", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022193"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "16", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/17433259400", "authid": "17433259400", "authname": "Chia H.B.", "surname": "Chia", "given-name": "Ho Beng", "initials": "H.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60017161"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

In addition, moderated path analysis indicated that employees' sensitivity to others' favorable treatment strengthened the direct effect of servant leadership on LMX and its indirect effect on customer-oriented OCB. This study extends the scope of servant leadership research and provides evidence for arguments that servant leadership matters in the hospitality industry.

The theoretical and managerial implications of these results were discussed. \u00a9 2013 The British Psychological Society.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27867787900", "authid": "27867787900", "authname": "Kwan H.", "surname": "Kwan", "given-name": "Ho Kwong", "initials": "H.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032744"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26534766900", "authid": "26534766900", "authname": "Mao Y.", "surname": "Mao", "given-name": "Yina", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60033100"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

The authors also test the hypotheses of relational power with two well established power sources (position and personal power) and their relationships with influence strategies (persuasive, assertive and relationship-based). Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed a mixed method approach. The survey study included 438 Chinese respondents whereas the follow-up interview study included 17 managers from different industries, collected across main cities in China. Findings: The analysis of the data from survey responses provides support for the authors' argument regarding the existence of relational power. Survey results showed that all three power sources predicted leaders' choices of influence strategies. The follow-up qualitative findings from additional interviews with managers also shed interesting insights into the dynamics of different power sources. Research limitations/implications: The use of a convenience sample may limit the generalizability of the findings. Notwithstanding, the study contributes to the power literature by adding a new dimension to the existing power typology, thus helping us better understand how different power sources affect leaders' choices of influence strategies. Practical implications: The study offers new insights to both practitioners and academicians, which is of growing importance because knowledge on power sources and understanding how it operates should help managers consciously cultivate desirable types of power. This study also shows the dynamics of guanxi, thus helping the Westerners better understand work relationships in China and understand why guanxi/relational power is effective here. Originality/value: The paper integrates the power-dependency theory and an indigenous Chinese construct - guanxi and empirically examines how the authors' proposed power source - relational power - affects leaders' choices of influence strategies. The paper argues that by adding this new power source to the power typology which has dominated the power literature for half a century can fully capture the sources of power embedded in an organizational setting, and generate practical implications on leader-member interactions. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25521146500", "authid": "25521146500", "authname": "Chong M.P.M.", "surname": "Chong", "given-name": "Melody P.M.", "initials": "M.P.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013983"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55376233600", "authid": "55376233600", "authname": "Shang Y.F.", "surname": "Shang", "given-name": "Yu Fan", "initials": "Y.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018308"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

To date, the majority of research on EI and personality has shown their significant influence on personal outcomes. It has also been suggested that empowerment is a fundamental psychological mechanism underlying follower outcomes. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the effect of team leaders' EI and personality on team outcomes and the potential mediating effect of team leaders' empowering behavior. In this study, we developed theoretical rationale and empirically tested the effect of team leaders' EI and personality on team climate and the mediating role that team leaders' empowering behavior plays in this relationship. The results supported most of our hypothesized relationships, that is, the positive effects of team leaders' EI and agreeableness on team climate were mediated by team leaders' empowering behavior, whereas team leaders' openness to new experience was not related to empowering behavior and team climate. Finally, theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

We report the society scores for SVS values dimensions for both individual- and societal-level analyses. At the individual-level, we report on the ten circumplex values sub-dimensions and two sets of values dimensions (collectivism and individualism; openness to change, conservation, self-enhancement, and self-transcendence). At the societal-level, we report on the values dimensions of embeddedness, hierarchy, mastery, affective autonomy, intellectual autonomy, egalitarianism, and harmony. For each society, we report the Cronbach's \u03b1 statistics for each values dimension scale to assess their internal consistency (reliability) as well as report interrater agreement (IRA) analyses to assess the acceptability of using aggregated individual level values scores to represent country values. We also examined whether societal development level is related to systematic variation in the measurement and importance of values. Thus, the contributions of our evaluation of the SVS values dimensions are two-fold. First, we identify the SVS dimensions that have cross-culturally internally reliable structures and within-society agreement for business professionals. Second, we report the society cultural values scores developed from the twenty-first century data that can be used as macro-level predictors in multilevel and single-level international business

Based on the evolving crossvergence theory of macro-level predictors of values evolution, we demonstrate the applicability of crossvergence theory in the micro-level context. Furthermore, our study provides the first empirical multi-level analysis of influence ethics utilizing a multiple-country sample. Thus, we illustrate how the breath of crossvergence can be expanded to provide a multi-level theoretical foundation of values and behavior evolution across cultures. Specifically, we integrate micro-level life stage theory and macro-level societal culture theory to concurrently assess the contributions of each theory in explaining subordinate influence ethics across the diverse societies of Brazil, China, Germany and the U.S. Consistent with previous research, we found significant societal differences in influence ethics. However, we also found that life stage theory played a significant role in understanding influence ethics. Thus, our findings expand the crossvergence perspective on societal change, indicating that key micro-level predictors (e.g., life stage) should be included in cross-cultural research. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the authors tested whether social exchange and job embeddedness mediate how mutual-investment (whereby employers offer high inducements to employees for their high contributions) and over-investment (high inducements without corresponding high expected contributions) EOR approaches, which are based on Tsui, Pearce, Porter, and Tripoli's (1997) framework, affect quit propensity and organizational commitment. Two studies evaluated these intervening mechanisms. Study 1 surveyed 953 Chinese managers attending part-time master of business administration (MBA) programs in China, whereas Study 2 collected cross-sectional and longitudinal data from 526 Chinese middle managers in 41 firms. Standard and multilevel causal modeling techniques affirmed that social exchange and job embeddedness translate EOR influence. A second multilevel test using lagged outcome measures further established that job embeddedness mediates long-term EOR effects over 18 months. These findings corroborate prevailing views that social exchange explains how mutual- and over-investment EORs motivate greater workforce commitment and loyalty. This study enriches EOR perspectives by identifying job embeddedness as another mediator that is more enduring than social exchange. \u00a9 2009 American Psychological Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602184203", "authid": "6602184203", "authname": "Hom P.W.", "surname": "Hom", "given-name": "Peter W.", "initials": "P.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003892"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006812715", "authid": "7006812715", "authname": "Tsui A.S.", "surname": "Tsui", "given-name": "Anne S.", "initials": "A.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003892"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8597188400", "authid": "8597188400", "authname": "Wu J.B.", "surname": "Wu", "given-name": "Joshua B.", "initials": "J.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029251"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7501442536", "authid": "7501442536", "authname": "Lee T.W.", "surname": "Lee", "given-name": "Thomas W.", "initials": "T.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015481"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56032559600", "authid": "56032559600", "authname": "Zhang A.Y.", "surname": "Zhang", "given-name": "Ann Yan", "initials": "A.Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014966"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56094151700", "authid": "56094151700", "authname": "Li L.", "surname": "Li", "given-name": "Lan", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "106962769"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

The power impulse has two forms: explicit, in leaders; implicit, in their followers. When men willingly follow a leader, they do so with a view to the acquisition of power by the group which he commands, and they feel that his triumphs are theirs. (Russell 1938: 16). The above averment by Bertrand Russell, the recipient of the 1950 Nobel Prize for literature, resonates with the Tao of value leadership. In his Book of Tao (Tao-Te-Ching), Lao-Tze says, \u201cwhen people speak about a good emperor, they would say: \u2018He has done this and he has done that.\u2019 But when they speak of a superior emperor, they would say: \u2018We have done it all ourselves\u2019\u201d (Siu 1980: 32). By the Tao of value leadership, we refer to the ultimate realm as well as the most desirable level leadership can reach: the level when leaders and followers share the same values and become truly interdependent and do their best to achieve their goals. In that process, leadership power, like energy in physics (Russell 1938), acts as a special type of force, not as \u201cabilities\u201d (e.g., Etzioni 1961; Pfeffer 1992) or \u201cpotential influence\u201d (e.g., French and Raven 1959), enabling the leader to achieve the highest level. Leadership power is \u201ca special form of power,\u201d which consists of two interrelated essentials \u201cmotive and resource\u201d (Burns 1979: 12). \u201cLacking motive, resource diminishes; lacking resource, motive lies idle; lacking either one, power collapses\u201d (Burns 1979: 12).", "aggregation_type": "Book", "subtype": "ch", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55587411900", "authid": "55587411900", "authname": "Fu C.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Caroline", "initials": "C."}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

Design/methodology/approach - CEOs, TMT members, and lower-level employees of 200 firms in the telecommunication industry in Mainland China were surveyed. Survey data collected from 123 CEOs, 442 TMT members, and 894 employees and archival data of firm performance were matched for hierarchical regression modeling (HRM) analyses. Findings - Results show relationship conflict reduces team cohesiveness and both relationship and task conflicts are negatively related to firm performance. With relationship conflict, the results show using compromising approach could help reduce its negative effects on TMT cohesiveness and firm performance; but avoiding either type of conflict will undermine both team and firm outcomes. Accommodating approach does not have significant moderating effect on conflict-outcome relationships. Research limitations/implications - The study reveals some interesting insights, but it does not include any contextual variables such as firm culture or team norms or climate which are shown to relate to both conflict types and conflict management approaches. Originality/value - By examining the interplay between conflict types and conflict management approaches, the paper offers interesting insights into the connection between nature of conflicts, conflict management, employee-rated TMT effectiveness, and objective firm performance. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27170043400", "authid": "27170043400", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Pingping", "initials": "P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55745238400", "authid": "55745238400", "authname": "Liu S.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Songbo", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014402"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Interview data were collected from 52 TMT members in 16 Chinese entrepreneurial high tech firms, and were transcribed, coded and analyzed according to Thomas's typology of conflict handling approaches. Findings \u2013 Results show that conflicts in those TMTs were mostly task-related and integration/ collaboration was the most frequently used approach to handle conflicts, in contrast to the findings of previous studies with Chinese managers that reported avoidance to be most preferred. It was found that the most preferred approach used in the team also relates to the leadership style of the team leader. Research limitations/implications \u2013 Methodologically, the paper did not apply any quantitative approach to triangulate the findings for greater reliability nor did it propose predictors of any type of conflict-handling approach. Also, analyses were done at the individual level. However, the results add to the conflict-resolution literature, and provide insights on conflict resolution processes in Chinese TMTs, which, in turn, will help to understand better Chinese TMT processes. Practical implications \u2013 The results provide very practical guidance to TMTs and help generalize the theories that have been developed based on Western practices. Originality/value \u2013 The study is first of its kind to examine conflict type and conflict handling approaches; and in Chinese high tech firms. It offers some interesting insights to the topic. \u00a9 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Ping fu P.", "surname": "Ping fu", "given-name": "Ping", "initials": "P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191768203", "authid": "57191768203", "authname": "Huang Yan X.", "surname": "Huang Yan", "given-name": "Xue", "initials": "X.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018038"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24179167100", "authid": "24179167100", "authname": "li Y.", "surname": "li", "given-name": "Yongjuan", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019499"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7403414094", "authid": "7403414094", "authname": "Wang E.", "surname": "Wang", "given-name": "Erping", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019499"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15844344300", "authid": "15844344300", "authname": "Peng S.", "surname": "Peng", "given-name": "Siqing", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014966"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

A total of 488 managers rated 16 influence tactics on their effectiveness across three influence directions - upward, downward and lateral. Consistently, these 16 tactics fell into two broad dimensions of influence - the more nurturing Gentle Persuasion (GP) and the more agentic Contingent Control (CC). The perceived effectiveness of GP increased with higher position power of the target, and vice versa for CC. No cultural differences were found for the rated effectiveness of CC. However, regardless of the influence direction, Americans managers rated GP as most effective; Mainland Chinese, the least. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that Reward for Application predicted a manager's endorsement of GP as more effective, and Fate Control of CC. The effect of Fate Control on CC was, however, moderated by culture, exemplifying culture's sensitizing role in directing member responses.

The relationships between three types of broad influence strategy (persuasive, assertive, and relationship based) and four dimensions of individual beliefs (cynicism, fate control, reward for application, and religiosity) were examined. Three of Project GLOBE's cultural values (in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and future orientation) were selected to investigate their direct effects on the rated effectiveness of influence strategies, and their possible interaction with dimensions of individual beliefs. Results showed that different dimensions of individual social beliefs predict the perceived effectiveness of the three types of influence strategy, and that cultural values can moderate the strength of the relationship between these dimensions of individual social beliefs and the perceived effectiveness of influence strategies.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7404198444", "authid": "7404198444", "authname": "Kennedy J.", "surname": "Kennedy", "given-name": "Jeff", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60112754"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101690060", "authid": "7101690060", "authname": "Tata J.", "surname": "Tata", "given-name": "Jasmine", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003545"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60003545"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602200017", "authid": "6602200017", "authname": "Yukl G.", "surname": "Yukl", "given-name": "Gary", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011666"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7202608757", "authid": "7202608757", "authname": "Bond M.H.", "surname": "Bond", "given-name": "Michael Harris", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25026304800", "authid": "25026304800", "authname": "Peng T.K.", "surname": "Peng", "given-name": "Tai Kuang", "initials": "T.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60024908"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8848750600", "authid": "8848750600", "authname": "Srinivas E.S.", "surname": "Srinivas", "given-name": "Ekkirala S.", "initials": "E.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60086128"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7402273551", "authid": "7402273551", "authname": "Howell J.P.", "surname": "Howell", "given-name": "Jon P.", "initials": "J.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002162"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22951798300", "authid": "22951798300", "authname": "Prieto L.", "surname": "Prieto", "given-name": "Leonel", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002162"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "10", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102712073", "authid": "7102712073", "authname": "Koopman P.", "surname": "Koopman", "given-name": "Paul", "initials": "P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008734"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "11", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56985611300", "authid": "56985611300", "authname": "Boonstra J.J.", "surname": "Boonstra", "given-name": "Jaap J.", "initials": "J.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008734"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "12", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602757864", "authid": "6602757864", "authname": "Pasa S.", "surname": "Pasa", "given-name": "Selda", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60005803"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "13", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507060911", "authid": "6507060911", "authname": "Lacassagne M.F.", "surname": "Lacassagne", "given-name": "Marie Francoise", "initials": "M.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "126105699"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "14", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801446157", "authid": "7801446157", "authname": "Higashide H.", "surname": "Higashide", "given-name": "Hiro", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023462"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "15", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6504323572", "authid": "6504323572", "authname": "Cheosakul A.", "surname": "Cheosakul", "given-name": "Adith", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138776"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

Although cultural norms in a society can lead to preferences for certain types of behaviour, status and organizational culture are also determinants in interpersonal relations. To demonstrate this phenomenon, a questionnaire was presented to middle managers belonging to different cultures Chinese/French) and working in different sectors of activity (finance/industry). The participants were asked to evaluate strategies for dealing with situations in which a manager asks the target (of superior, equal or inferior status) to carry out a task. The results reveal some cultural similarities: there is relative consensus between Chinese and French managers on the strategies to adopt according to the status of the target. However, differences were also identified: in China there is more focus on relations with greater flexibility concerning social position. It appears therefore that certain values are necessary to participate in the phenomenon of globalisation, but these values seem to be negotiable, if not entirely negotiated, according to the culture. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier SAS.

The results suggest that, by publicizing and adorning specific leaders in both government and business sectors in the official media, the government reinforces the traditional values that are consistent with communist ideologies, and at the same time, it also introduces Western management values to suit the current needs of the society.

This study examines the relationship between societal changes, especially the change in culture, and the change in leadership styles. The subjects of this study are Chinese managers in four major Oriental Chinese societies: Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is argued that, due to different political, economical, and cultural developments in recent decades, the leadership styles in these Chinese societies have also changed in different directions. Based on data from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Program (GLOBE) study, our findings show some significant and interesting differences in leadership style among business leaders in these Chinese societies. The implications of the findings are discussed. \u00a9 de Sitter Publications 2002.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55720555500", "authid": "55720555500", "authname": "Li J.", "surname": "Li", "given-name": "Ji", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60199588"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003566742", "authid": "7003566742", "authname": "Chow I.", "surname": "Chow", "given-name": "Irene", "initials": "I.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25026304800", "authid": "25026304800", "authname": "Peng T.K.", "surname": "Peng", "given-name": "T.

Focusing on the HRM practices in ten different TVE organizations in a new city in Southeastern China, this study aims at filling a gap in the literature by exploring the general HRM practices in those organizations. Results show that HRM practices in TVEs, although still relatively primitive compared to those in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), have been much more formalized recently. Employees are now mostly selected rather than referred by existing employees or 'guanxi' as they were previously. New employees in many large TVEs are now trained through formal procedures rather than through apprenticeships, and pay is tightly linked to performance and skill levels. However, in smaller TVEs, HR practices are less formalized. The study points out that the firm size may be an institutional factor affecting the implementation of formal HRM practices. Yet, regardless of the form of personnel management, HRM practices are shown to be a very important factor in the economic success of TVE firms. Further studies are necessary to understand HRM and other managerial practices in TVEs and to test the relationships between HRM practices and firm performance among the TVEs.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003566742", "authid": "7003566742", "authname": "Chow I.", "surname": "Chow", "given-name": "Irene Hau Siu", "initials": "I.H.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15058882300", "authid": "15058882300", "authname": "Fu P.", "surname": "Fu", "given-name": "Ping Ping", "initials": "P.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002798"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15058882300"}

To investigate this question further, we surveyed managers and subordinates in two samples and interviewed managers individually or in focus groups. The use of delegation and consultation with individual subordinates was determined in part by characteristics of the subordinates and the manager-subordinate relationship. More delegation was used for a subordinate who was competent, shared the leader's task objectives, had worked longer for the manager, was a supervisor also, and had a favorable exchange relationship with the manager. Consultation with a subordinate was predicted by goal congruence, subordinate job level, and quality of the leader-member exchange relationship. The managers acknowledged that developing subordinates and empowering them to do their work were important reasons for delegation, but many managers were reluctant to give up control over important decisions or assign an important task to an inexperienced subordinate.

Although efficiency may be gained by maintaining higher patient volume per nurse (higher workload), high-quality patient care requires low levels of nurse turnover, which might be adversely affected by an increase in workload. Purpose Drawing upon job demands-resources theory, we hypothesized that hospital-level workload will predict nurse turnover and that nurse turnover will predict patient mortality, and that registered nurse hiring rates and human resource management practices will moderate (buffer) the positive relationship between nurse workload and nurse turnover, whereas quality care structures will moderate (buffer) the positive relationship between nurse turnover and patient mortality. Methods We tested this model utilizing multiple sources of time-lagged data collected from a sample of 156 hospitals in the United States. Results Our findings suggest that (a) nurse workload is associated with higher nurse turnover, (b) nurse turnover is positively associated with patient mortality, (c) nurse staffing buffers the workload-turnover relationship as a first-stage moderator, and (d) quality care structures act as a second-stage moderator that mitigates the effects of turnover on mortality.

HR practices can serve as either job resources or challenge demands to employees, thereby having differential effects on the psychological, physical, and social dimensions of wellbeing. We integrate a measure of challenge demand (including time pressure and workload) as a mediator to further reveal how these different categories of HR practices influence employee wellbeing. Using structural equation modeling in a dataset of 4823 individual workers from a National Workplace Survey of Employees conducted in Ireland, we find that job resource HR practices are positively associated with all three dimensions of wellbeing both directly and indirectly, while challenge demand HR practices are positively associated with psychological wellbeing but negatively associated with physical wellbeing and social wellbeing primarily through the mediating effect of time pressure and workload.

In our framework, we theorize how the HR function's relational activities lead to superior firm performance by enhancing the firm's HCRs and identify the firm's strategic HR systems and human capital losses as factors that complement and necessitate the HR function's relational activities, respectively. Using a five-wave, nationally representative panel dataset covering 1415 firm observations, we find robust support for our hypotheses: the HR function's relational activities were positively related to HCRs, which was more pronounced when coupled with high levels of strategic HR systems and human capital losses. The HCRs, in turn, transmitted the effects of the relational activities on the firm's subsequent operational and financial performance.

Taking this argument further, we suggest that when frictions for one type of human capital decrease, firms are motivated to place greater emphasis on human capital that is interdependent in production where frictions are unchanged. Empirically, we exploit an exogenous institutional change in the National Football League to demonstrate that coaching (managerial) dismissal and replacement is more likely to occur (and is influenced by a wider variety of information) after frictions for player (production worker) human capital decrease. Our findings suggest adding a new dimension\u2014tradeoffs between related labor market segments\u2014to the scholarly conversation about how firms manage their human capital (and other resources) strategically. Managerial Summary: We often point to the existence of labor market frictions for different types of human capital as reasons why firms would emphasize one type of human capital over another. But changes in frictions in markets for related human capital, the present focus, can influence this decision as well. In particular, our study demonstrates that when the NFL implemented free agency and a salary cap in the market for player talent in 1993, limiting the ability of teams to stockpile talented players, NFL teams responded by increasing their emphasis on coaching talent in the production of wins. This increased emphasis manifested in more frequent coaching dismissals and a greater influence of different types of information on the desirability of replacing a team's head coach after 1993.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56266317600", "authid": "56266317600", "orcid": "0000-0001-5690-5843", "authname": "Allen W.D.", "surname": "Allen", "given-name": "W.

Based on an extensive literature review, we first distill the commonalities and core attributes of pipelines and then develop a theory-driven typology to ensure a consistency in understanding. Next, we suggest that a common theoretical justification runs through the uses of pipelines: Pipelines address labor market imperfections confronted by firms when they staff positions, counterbalancing the seemingly detrimental reduction in candidates that pipelines engender. We use this insight to theoretically delineate why different types of pipelines exist. Finally, we discuss how firms develop unique combinations, or portfolios, of pipelines to ameliorate the range of imperfections that they face to manage talent sourcing across the enterprise.

We employ a larger, more generalizable sample, a model better fitted to the IPO context, and alternative performance measures to execute a more robust examination of this relationship. Using Welbourne and Cyr's model specifications, our results parallel theirs: there is no significant relationship between HREs and firms' post-IPO financial performance. Moreover, extending Welbourne and Cyr's study, we find that the presence of HREs at the time of firms' IPOs is positively related to the ultimate success measure: post-IPO firm survival. Additionally, for firms that had executives at the time of IPO, the negative effect of firm size on firm mortality is greater and the positive effect of leverage on firm mortality is smaller. Managerial summary: Does paying attention to HRM help firms to succeed? This study examines that question in a sample of generally small, young firms that went public from 1996 to 2008. Only about 10 percent of these firms had human resource executives (HREs) at the time of their IPOs, allowing us to examine the effects of the presence of HREs on firm performance. While we find that the presence of an HRE at IPO is not related to firms' post-IPO financial performance, firms that had HREs at IPO are significantly more likely to survive in the long run. Since approximately 20 percent of the sample firms do not survive, this is a very meaningful outcome. Indeed, survival may be the ultimate measure of firm performance.

Some have also suggested that managerial dismissal stems particularly from shortfalls of performance relative to expectations, whether in relation to corporate executives or the managers of professional sports teams. But relatively few have investigated the role of expectations empirically, owing to difficulties in measuring them. In this article, we address this question theoretically by framing the interaction of performance, expectations, and the use (and potential dismissal) of managers as a labor demand problem, using applied microeconomic tools to demonstrate how variation in expectations and performance can alter how a National Football League (NFL) organization employs player and coaching talent. Empirically, we take advantage of an institutional change-the NFL's adoption of a salary cap and free agency in the early 1990s-to isolate an exogenous change in performance expectations. While the salary cap constrained the amount clubs could spend annually on player talent, it placed no constraint on expenditures for managerial (coaching) talent. This may have led clubs to allocate more resources toward coaching talent and consequently place higher expectations on head coaches, resulting in a greater probability of dismissal in the postcap period. Using data on NFL head coaches from 1979 to 2006 and probit models of turnover, we find that the probability of coach dismissal increased in the postcap era and that concrete measures of an organization's player talent, coaching talent, and on-field performance gained importance as determinants of turnover from the pre- to the postcap era, indicative of increased expectations. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56266317600", "authid": "56266317600", "authname": "Allen W.", "surname": "Allen", "given-name": "W.

However, there are few empirical studies that examine such moderating effects. Using a sample of 161 firms in South Korea, this study investigates how the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance is moderated by three context variables: (1) the degree of organizational usage of employee involvement practices, (2) the degree of organizational investment in employee training and development, and (3) the availability of potential workers. The results demonstrate that employee involvement practices significantly amplify the negative relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance, give marginal support for moderation from the availability of potential workers, and provide no support for moderation from the degree of organizational investment in employee training and development.

Specifically, the authors' survey of 186 recent empirical tests of RBT suggests that measures of intangibles are often assigned with little theoretical conceptualization of the intangible construct or connection with RBT. This lack of theoretical justification undermines confidence in measures and empirical findings, leaves central RBT questions unaddressed, and constricts the usefulness of RBT. Furthermore, their survey suggests that the dominant approach to measuring intangibles is mechanical and unidisciplinary (i.e., rooted in either economics or psychology). The authors argue that the challenge of measuring intangibles is primarily theoretical. Thus, mechanical and unidisciplinary approaches are problematic for they sustain theoretical disconnects among RBT and intangible conceptualizations and measures. Moreover, a multidisciplinary construct validation approach is required to remedy the respective deficiencies of economic and psychological approaches and integrate their complementary strengths. The authors present such an approach, which they call the multidisciplinary assessment process (MAP). The MAP guides scholars in creating theories of intangibles that are specific to their RBT study. These theories are the focal point of the MAP and clarify what, specifically, the intangible is and how firms use the intangible to create and appropriate economic value. In turn, these theories inform the measurement and validation steps of the MAP, so that intangibles are assessed with greater credibility. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25650298000", "authid": "25650298000", "authname": "Molloy J.C.", "surname": "Molloy", "given-name": "Janice C.", "initials": "J.C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60031707"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006657921", "authid": "7006657921", "authname": "Chadwick C.", "surname": "Chadwick", "given-name": "Clint", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015457"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004208559", "authid": "7004208559", "authname": "Ployhart R.E.", "surname": "Ployhart", "given-name": "Robert E.", "initials": "R.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018179"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55560405500", "authid": "55560405500", "authname": "Golden S.J.", "surname": "Golden", "given-name": "Simon J.", "initials": "S.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60031707"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7006657921"}

Each of these approaches to synergy is better fitted to some contingencies than to others and is operationalized by different methodologies. Recognizing these different varieties of HRM system synergy allows researchers to better understand and estimate the impact of HRM systems on organizational performance.

Human resource management (HRM) activities, on the other hand, assume strategic significance by supporting the three cases above through a process that we call managerial entrepreneurship. Furthermore, HRM takes on different forms when supporting each of these types of rents. Hence, this rent-based view has greater potential to help explain the contribution of human resources to firms' competitive advantages than approaches that are grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, which primarily reflects the Ricardian view of rents.

This research provides an objective look at the results of restructuring/reengineering hospitals and an examination of the influences on employee perceptions of reengineering's outcomes. This research demonstrates that employees, including upper management, had little or no objective knowledge of the outcomes of their change efforts. However, perceptions of all employees involved in a major change effort are critical if their full participation is to be sustained. The ultimate sustainability of many hospital strategic change efforts may rest largely on subjective assessments of its outcomes. The research reported here suggests that such perceptions vary significantly by organizational level and may not be stable over time. While the passage of time sees improvements in managers' perceptions of reengineering results, line personnel become increasingly skeptical and less positive.

We extend this work by studying whether digitization influences the products created. Using unique data on movies, we examine whether the reduced costs of production and new digital distribution channels spur producers to create products aimed at smaller audiences. We employ a flexible, transparent, and largely graphical empirical approach to document changes unfolding with digitization. We find growth in both intended blockbuster and long tail products, but also, the rise of a \u201cmiddle tail,\u201d movies distributed via digital channels, with budgets suggesting commercial intent but well below the averages for theatrical distribution. The new middle tail is largely due to newcomers rather than major incumbents.

With lower costs, movies no longer need to be \u201cblockbusters\u201d at the box office to be financially successful. In this article, we study whether digitization has spurred an increase in lower-budget movies that are not aimed for release in theaters.

Specifically, we use an inductive study of earnings conference call transcripts and analyst reports to study how analysts' evaluative schemas change with technological change in the wireline telecommunications industry. We find three temporal themes.At first, analysts pressure firms to reverse strategic changes that are at odds with the existing \"income\"-focused metrics and logic that constitute the evaluative schema. Next, schema change unfolds with the ongoing technological change, as firm performance declines when measured with traditional metrics, and as managers frame strategic changes using new \"growth\"-focused metrics and logic. Finally, a distinct shift in the schema is apparent as analysts' increasing attention to growth spurs a more positive view of strategic changes that they previously opposed, a less positive view of previously supported strategies that conformed to an income logic, and the application of the growth logic even to a firm not pursuing growth-oriented strategic changes. Results from a supplementary content analysis support these results, showing a temporal shift toward \"growth\" words in analyst reports and conference calls. Our process model emphasizes the gradual shifts in analysts' evaluative schemas that ultimately support firm responses to a new technology.

These changes have influenced the strategic positioning of major and independent record labels. We examine the new music releases of major and independent labels before and after the technological change, using a differences-in-differences design and unique data on over 63,000 albums released in the United States between 1990 and 2010. We find, first, that major labels increasingly choose artists that have been previously successful, both on the same label and on other labels; second, that music releases increase for independent labels but decrease for major labels; and third, that this selective approach appears to work, as a growing share of major label releases achieve commercial success on the Billboard charts. Despite growing relative success, because overall revenue is declining in the industry, U.S. revenues for major labels fall, while the revenues of independent labels are stable. Our results support the idea that major labels deploy their high-cost capabilities in a narrowing segment of the market, releasing successful artists that have broad market appeal and high revenue, while independents adopt lower cost approaches, pursuing more music releases for smaller, lower revenue audiences. Thus, prechange strategic positions appear to influence the labels' responses to-and adoption of-the technological change, resulting in even more heterogeneous positions post-change.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8777448400", "authid": "8777448400", "authname": "Benner M.J.", "surname": "Benner", "given-name": "Mary J.", "initials": "M.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60123802"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005529339", "authid": "7005529339", "authname": "Waldfogel J.", "surname": "Waldfogel", "given-name": "Joel", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60123802"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020337"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "8777448400"}

Controlling for firm financial performance and capabilities, we find that analysts were consistently more positive toward the cable firms than toward the wireline telecom firms. Our findings further show that this divergence in reactions arises from differences in existing investor expectations and preferences concerning how firms create value; stocks owned by investors with a greater preference for growth receive more positive reactions than those owned by investors with a greater preference for margins. However, this divergence in reactions shrinks over time as convergence unfolds and as investors shift their shareholdings in response to misalignment between their preferences and firms' strategic changes.

Radical technological changes provide a source of exogenous variation that contributes to explanation of how firms balance technological pressures for adaptation and institutional pressures for legitimacy. \u00a9 2012 Academy of Management Journal.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8777448400", "authid": "8777448400", "authname": "Benner M.J.", "surname": "Benner", "given-name": "Mary J.", "initials": "M.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029445"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55101608800", "authid": "55101608800", "authname": "Ranganathan R.", "surname": "Ranganathan", "given-name": "Ram", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60006297"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "8777448400"}

While it is widely acknowledged that managers face pressures from financial markets to choose strategies that maximize shareholder value, little work in the technological change literature has considered the possible influences of public equity markets and the securities analysts who mediate them on incumbent firms challenged with technological change. In this paper, I begin to address the topic by empirically exploring how securities analysts react to the different strategies undertaken by incumbent firms faced with radical technological change. I study the question in two settings: the shift to digital technology in photography and the advent of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology in wireline telecommunications. I find evidence that analysts are more attentive and positive toward incumbents' strategies that extend and preserve the existing technology than toward strategies that respond directly to the new technology. In these settings, analysts largely ignore incumbents' strategies that directly incorporate the new technology for several years following the discontinuity. This study provides insights into the nature and direction of analysts' reactions to firms' strategies in the context of technological change, and is a first step toward better understanding of the potential role of analysts' and financial markets in incumbent adaptation. \u00a9 2010 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8777448400", "authid": "8777448400", "authname": "Benner M.", "surname": "Benner", "given-name": "Mary J.", "initials": "M.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022452"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "8777448400"}

Within this research, there is controversy about whether organizational routines hamper or facilitate adaptation. Organizational routines give rise to inertia but are also the vehicles for change in recent work on dynamic capabilities. This rising interest in routines in research coincides with an increase in management practices focused on organizational routines and processes. This study explores how the increasing use of process management practices affected organizational response to a major technological change through new product developments. The empirical setting is the photography industry over a decade, during the shift from silver-halide chemistry to digital technology. The advent and rise of practices associated with the new ISO 9000 certification program in the 1990s coincided with increasing technological substitution in photography, allowing for assessing how increasing attention to routines through ISO 9000 practices over time affected ongoing responsiveness to the technological change. The study further compares the effects for the incumbent firms in the existing technology with nonincumbent firms entering from elsewhere. Relying on longitudinal panel data models as well as hazard models, findings show that greater process management practices dampened response to new generations of digital technology, but this effect differed for incumbents and nonincumbents. Increasing use of process management practices over time had a greater negative effect on incumbents' response to the rapid technological change. The study contributes to research in technological change by highlighting specific management practices that may create disconnects between firms' capabilities and changing environments and disadvantage incumbents in the face of radical technological change. This research also contributes to literature on organizational routines and capabilities. Studying the effects of increasing ISO 9000 practices undertaken in firms provides an opportunity to gauge the effects of systematic routinization of organizational activities and their effects on adaptation. This research also contributes to management practice. The promise of process management is to help firms adapt to changing environments, and, as such, managers facing technological change may adopt process management practices as a response to uncertainty and change. But managers must more fully understand the potential benefits and risks of process management to ensure these practices are used in the appropriate contexts. \u00a9 2009 Product Development & Management Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8777448400", "authid": "8777448400", "authname": "Benner M.", "surname": "Benner", "given-name": "Mary J.", "initials": "M.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022452"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "8777448400"}

Researchers have measured firms' technological or knowledge proximities with a variety of measures based on patent data, including Euclidean distances (using the technological classifications listed on patents), and overlap in cited patents. Often research has employed only the first listed patent classification in measures of proximities. We explore the effects of using the first listed patent class as well as other methods to measure proximities. We point out that measures of proximity based on small numbers of patents are imprecisely measured random variables. Measures computed on samples with few patents or a single patent class generate both biased and imprecise measures of proximity. We discuss the implications of this for typical research questions employing measures of proximity, and explore the effects of larger sample sizes and coarser patent class breakdowns in mitigating these problems. Where possible, we suggest that researchers increase their sample sizes by aggregating years or using all of the listed patent classes on a patent, rather than just the first. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we use longitudinal panel data on ISO 9000 practices for firms in the auto supplier industry to study two new issues related to the adoption of process management practices. First, we find that, as the majority of firms within an industry adopt ISO 9000, late adopters no longer gain financial benefits from these practices. Second, we explore how firms' technological coherence moderates the performance advantages of ISO 9000 practices. We find that firms that have a very narrow or very broad technological focus have fewer opportunities for complementary interactions that arise from process management practices and thus benefit less than those with limited breadth in technologically related activities. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Much of this work has focused on factors internal to firms, such as inertial routines or managers' cognitive limitations that constrain incumbents' development of new capabilities and response to new technologies. But institutional pressures arising from financial markets and the securities analysts who mediate such markets likely also play a role in whether and how incumbent firms respond to technological change. We know little about how financial markets and securities analysts react as an incumbent firm is faced with a radical technological discontinuity that threatens to substitute for the existing technology. Understanding such reactions is critical, as they further influence whether and how incumbents respond to technological discontinuities. In this article, I explore securities analysts' reactions to incumbent firms faced with technological discontinuities in two industries: digital technology in photography, and Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) technology in wireline telecommunications. I find that these discontinuities go largely unmentioned in analysts' reports and appear to have little influence on analysts' recommendations or stock prices even for several years. The findings suggest further that analysts and investors continue to reward incumbents for cash flows arising from focusing on the existing business and technology despite the increasing certainty of technological obsolescence. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

We further draw on Ric\u0153ur\u2019s ideas about narrative time to theorize how narratives are used by firms for temporal reorganization that can alter perceptions of plausibility and desirability, thereby increasing the overall persuasiveness of their futurescapes. We illustrate our arguments using narratives created by auto manufacturers in response to the changing landscape of their industry.

We build on psychological research on personal values to propose that values are complex cognitive resources, distinct from mental representations, beliefs, ideologies, identities, and emotions, that, when deployed in strategy making, affect the attributes of the strategies created. We specify how values affect the value-creation and value-capture potential of firms' strategies by theorizing four distinct functions of values in strategy making: as attentional structures, as valuation lenses, as design principles, and as identity markers. As attentional structures, values direct strategists' attention to specific issues and often unconventional solutions; as valuation lenses, they change the evaluation of relevant markets and resources; as design principles, they influence the prioritization and integration of activities; and as identity markers, they facilitate audience engagement and mobilization.

Individuals can develop multiple identities in the academic domain, and we anticipate that graduate students develop both an engineering identity and a research identity in their engineering graduate programs. Engineering identity development has mainly been investigated with undergraduate engineering students. The literature on graduate students' engineering identity development is relatively sparse, and the phenomenon has been investigated mostly using qualitative studies. Furthermore, research identity development has been studied with non-engineering doctoral students, but very few researchers have investigated engineering graduate students' research identity, even though engineering graduate students engage in research and develop research proficiency during their graduate studies. In this quantitative study, we incorporate findings from previous qualitative studies of engineering identity and researcher identity to 1) assess engineering identity and investigate its relationships with key factors affecting engineering identity development and 2) investigate researcher identity development among other graduate programs to investigate relationships between engineering graduate students' research identity and key factors affecting its development. We developed multi-item scales to measure engineering identity and research identity. Several items were borrowed and modified from undergraduate engineering identity studies and research identity studies in different disciplines. In addition, our survey included items that we generated to measure key factors that prior research suggests may affect these identities, namely engineering and research competencies, interest, and recognition. The survey was completed online by 115 mechanical engineering graduate students from a large public research university. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the items intended to measure engineering and research identities loaded onto their respective factors, and that the items created to measure engineering and research competencies, interest, and recognition loaded onto six factors: Engineering Competence, Engineering Interest, Research Competence, Research Interest, Math/Science Competence, and Interpersonal Skill Competence.

Many studies of engineering identity build off of prior work in math and science identity, emphasizing the academic aspects of engineering. However, affect towards professional practice is also central to engineering identity development. This paper describes the methods used to create a new survey measure of individuals' affect toward elements of engineering practice. We followed the item generation, refinement, and instrument validation steps required for psychometric validation of a new survey measure. We generated items deductively using the literature on engineering professional skills and practice and inductively based on interviews with practicing engineers, engineering graduate students, and engineering undergraduate students. We blended the inductively and deductively derived item lists to create a list of initial items for the measure. We circulated this list of items to a set of engineering and professional identity experts to establish face validity and made modifications based on their feedback. The final list included 34 items. These 34 items were administered in a questionnaire survey in the fall of 2016 to 1465 engineering undergraduates in three majors at two institutions. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and established internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha on a subset of the analytical sample data (n=384).

Our framework contributes a theoretical conceptualization that enhances our understanding of organizations' DM efforts, integrates current typologies, and suggests new directions of inquiry for management scholars as well as guidelines for practitioners in the area. \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27667862100", "authid": "27667862100", "authname": "Olsen J.", "surname": "Olsen", "given-name": "Jesse E.", "initials": "J.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027395"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102109403", "authid": "7102109403", "authname": "Martins L.", "surname": "Martins", "given-name": "Luis L.", "initials": "L.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116471"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7102109403"}

One such factor is the support that expatriates receive from host country nationals (HCNs) with whom they work. Researchers interested in understanding expatriate success have not closely examined the phenomenon from an HCN perspective, however. At the same time, although we have gained a significant understanding of the roles of psychological, organizational, and contextual variables in the international assignment, there is still much to be understood about how expatriates' demographic characteristics affect their experiences in international assignments. Current findings regarding the effects of demographic characteristics often are inconsistent, highlighting the need for more complex theorizing. This article reviews recent research on the effects of expatriate demographic characteristics and proposes a social identity approach to understanding how these characteristics affect HCN support for the expatriate. It also seeks to develop a theory that addresses discrepancies in extant empirical findings, provides propositions to guide future research in the study of expatriates, and discusses implications for both researchers and practitioners. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/27667862100", "authid": "27667862100", "authname": "Olsen J.E.", "surname": "Olsen", "given-name": "Jesse E.", "initials": "J.E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102109403", "authid": "7102109403", "authname": "Martins L.L.", "surname": "Martins", "given-name": "Luis L.", "initials": "L.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019647"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7102109403"}

However, organizations vary in the extent to which they respond to the pressures exerted by the rankings, and research to date has not examined why some organizations change in response to the rankings and others do not. This study develops and tests a model that examines how top managers' sensemaking of rankings affects organizational change. Specifically, the model proposes direct and moderated effects of a perceived discrepancy between the position assigned to an organization in the rankings and the position implied by the organization's identity in the minds of its top managers (referred to here as a \"perceived identity-reputation discrepancy\"), on the extent of change undertaken by the organization. The research context used for the study was U.S. graduate schools of business. The results show that, as expected, schools whose top managers believed that their rankings were discrepant from their own perceptions of their school's standing in the industry, were more likely to undertake organizational change. This relationship was moderated by top managers' perceptions of the strategic impact of the rankings, and by the strength and external orientation of organizational identity; the relationship was not moderated by the perceived validity of the rankings. Overall, the results suggest that managerial interpretations and organizational identity work in concert to explain variation across organizations in the extent to which rankings motivate organizational change. \u00a9 2005 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102109403", "authid": "7102109403", "authname": "Martins L.L.", "surname": "Martins", "given-name": "Luis L.", "initials": "L.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116662"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7102109403"}

Our findings illuminate the complex relationship between entrepreneurs\u2019 motivations and capability, and highlight the strategies entrepreneurs use when they seek to resist corruption without compromising their resource needs.

To resolve this uncertainty, we investigate how and why CEO overconfidence is related to firm performance using meta-analytic techniques on a sample of 199 studies. In particular, relying on behavioral decision theory, we develop alternative hypotheses regarding the impact of CEO overconfidence on firm performance. Contrary to the conventional belief that CEO overconfidence is detrimental, this study reveals that CEO overconfidence is, on average, beneficial for firm performance. Drawing on recent refinements of upper echelons theory and theoretical insights from the psychology literature, we then dive deeper into this positive relationship and hypothesize that overconfident CEOs engage in strategic risk taking through cognitive, motivational, and social mechanisms. This risk taking is positively related to firm performance. Our results confirm that the positive relationship between CEO overconfidence and firm performance is partially mediated through strategic risk taking.

Although extant empirical studies have explored the performance implications of founders\u2019 breadth of experience at the start-up stage, we focus on the later stage of the initial public offering (IPO). We theorize that investors categorize venture founders based on two salient dimensions\u2014their industry and functional background\u2014and we relate this categorization to resource acquisition at IPO. To test our model, we use a hand-collected data set of 175 entrepreneurial IPOs in the Alternative Investment Market in London (2002\u20132013) and two randomized experiments. We theorize and find that compared with entrepreneurial ventures with a lead founder specializing in one industry or one function, investors generally devalue those with a category-spanning lead founder (a generalist). However, devaluation is less severe when a lead founder is a generalist in one dimension (e.g., industry) but a specialist in the other dimension (e.g., function). We also theorize and empirically test trust as a mechanism for the generalist penalty. Specifically, audience members (investors) have low trust in a generalist producer (founder) in contexts where the two parties consider entering into a partnership (equity investment at IPO), and so that generalist producer is devalued. Finally, we show that an external expert endorsement\u2014in our case, from intensive venture capital affiliations\u2014offsets the generalist penalty, especially when category spanning occurs in multiple category dimensions.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603626560", "authid": "6603626560", "orcid": "0000-0002-7889-0010", "authname": "Souitaris V.", "surname": "Souitaris", "given-name": "Vangelis", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020134"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027786"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216616168", "authid": "57216616168", "orcid": "0000-0002-8164-8823", "authname": "Peng B.", "surname": "Peng", "given-name": "Bo", "initials": "B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60009016"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506106502", "authid": "6506106502", "authname": "Zerbinati S.", "surname": "Zerbinati", "given-name": "Stefania", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020134"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60123158"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

By developing this framework, we (a) advance understanding of the micro-foundations of strategy by explaining how business model schemas can drive boundary object-based interactions that reveal the extent of business model coherence and affect the decision to change a business model; (b) offer a new pathway by which stakeholders inform value creation and value capture by providing new insights into how physical instantiations of business models and schema work together (via grounded cognition) to increase business model coherence; and (c) explain nuances in the relationship between boundary objects, business model coherence, and the decision to change a business model, and illustrate how the mechanisms that help create a viable new business model can also help overcome an actor's psychological obstruction tomaking a pivot.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021508"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210154800", "authid": "57210154800", "authname": "Seyb S.K.", "surname": "Seyb", "given-name": "Stella K.", "initials": "S.K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60030931"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201570526", "authid": "57201570526", "authname": "George G.", "surname": "George", "given-name": "Gerard", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023927"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

This challenge is intensifiedwhen dirty work is intractable- when it is difficult, if not impossible, for a person to avoid doing this work. Our study of meaning-making in the face of intractable dirty work examines ragpickers in Mumbai, India, who handle and dispose of garbage, and are further tainted by belonging to the lowest caste in Indian society, and living in slums. These ragpickers constructed both an overarching sense of helplessness rooted in the intractability of their situation, and a set of positive meanings-survival, destiny, and hope-rooted in specific facets of their lives and enacted through distinct temporal frames.

This paper briefly explains AI and looks into the future to highlight some of AI's broader and longer-term societal implications. We propose that AI can be combined with entrepreneurship to represent a super tool. Scholars can research the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship to explore the possibilities of this potential AI-entrepreneurship super tool and hopefully direct its use to productive processes and outcomes. We focus on specific entrepreneurship topics that benefit from AI's augmentation potential and acknowledge implications for entrepreneurship's dark side. We hope this paper stimulates future research at the AI-entrepreneurship nexus. Executive summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that are trained to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, interpret external data, learn from that external data, and use that learning to flexibly adapt to tasks to achieve specific outcomes. Machine learning is the most common form of AI and largely relies on supervised learning\u2014when the machine (i.e., AI) is trained with labels applied by humans. Deep learning and adversarial learning involve training on unlabeled data, or when the machine (via its algorithms) clusters data to reveal underlying patterns. AI is simply a tool. Entrepreneurship is also simply a tool. How they are combined and used will determine their impact on humanity. While researchers have independently developed a greater understanding of entrepreneurship and AI, these two streams of research have primarily run in parallel. To indicate the scope of current and future AI, we provide examples of AI (at different levels of development) for four sectors\u2014customer service, financial, healthcare, and tertiary education. Indeed, experts from industry research and consulting firms suggest many AI-related business opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue. Further, we elaborate on several of these opportunities, including opportunities to (1) capitalize on the \u201cfeeling economy,\u201d (2) redistribute occupational skills in the economy, (3) develop and use new governance mechanisms, (4) keep humans in the loop (i.e., humans as part of the decision making process), (5) expand the role of humans in developing AI systems, and (6) expand the purposes of AI as a tool. After discussing the range of business opportunities that experts suggest will prevail in the economy with AI, we discuss how entrepreneurs can use AI as a tool to help them increase their chances of entrepreneurial success. We focus on four up-and-coming areas for entrepreneurship research: a more interaction-based perspective of (potential) entrepreneurial opportunities, a more activities-based micro-foundation approach to entrepreneurial action, a more cognitively hot perspective of entrepreneurial decision making and action, and a more compassionate and prosocial role of entrepreneurial action. As we discuss each topic, we also suggest opportunities to design an AI system (i.e., entrepreneurs as potential AI designers) to help entrepreneurs (i.e., entrepreneurs as AI users). AI is an exciting development in the technology world. How it transforms markets and societies depends in large part on entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs can use AI to augment their decisions and actions in pursuing potential opportunities for productive gains. Thus, we discuss entrepreneurs' most critical tasks in developing and managing AI and explore some of the dark-side aspects of AI. Scholars also have a role to play in how entrepreneurs use AI, but this role requires the hard work of theory building, theory elaboration, theory testing, and empirical theorizing. We offer some AI topics that we hope future entrepreneurship research will explore. We hope this paper encourages scholars to consider research at the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021508"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004097019", "authid": "7004097019", "authname": "Majchrzak A.", "surname": "Majchrzak", "given-name": "Ann", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029311"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Although we know how entrepreneurial ventures gain initial access to resources, we do not yet fully understand how they maintain their resource mobilization, particularly in the face of potential threats. During our 11-month study of prosocial ventures that emerged to alleviate the suffering of refugees in Germany, four attacks on the European public occurred that were allegedly committed by refugees. These attacks disrupted the German welcoming culture for refugees, potentially threatening the legitimacy of the prosocial ventures' core activities. Thus, the attacks provide a starting point for examining how new prosocial ventures are able to maintain access to resources in the face of the potential withdrawal of resource holders. Theorizing from our data, we identify three distinct approaches to explain how prosocial ventures responded to the potential threat undermining the legitimacy of their activities to maintain access to resources. These approaches differ in their initial resource mobilization (i.e., based on the venture's goal for alleviating suffering), threat appraisals, and responses to maintain resource mobilization in the face of the potential delegitimization of their core activities.

But does formal educational attainment \u201cpay off\u201d in terms of job satisfaction? To answer this question, in Study 1 we use a metaanalytic technique to examine the correlation between educational attainment and job satisfaction (k = 74, N = 134,924) and find an effect size close to zero. We then build on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and research that distinguishes between working conditions and perceived stress to theorize that educational attainment involves notable trade-offs. In Study 2 we develop and test a multipath, two-stage mediation model using a nationally representative sample to explore this idea. We find that, while better-educated individuals enjoy greater job resources (income, job autonomy, and job variety), they also tend to incur greater job demands (work hours, task pressure, job intensity, and time urgency). On average, these demands are associated with increased job stress and decreased job satisfaction, largely offsetting the positive gains associated with greater resources. Given that the net relationship between education and job satisfaction emerges as weakly negative, we highlight that important trade-offs underlie the education\u2013job satisfaction link. In supplemental analyses, we identify boundary conditions based on gender and self-employment status (such that being female exacerbates, and being self-employed attenuates, the negative association between education and job satisfaction).

To address this important research gap, we draw from a real-time qualitative investigation of both the breaking and following of decision-making rules to develop a group model that: (1) explains how an individual can trigger his or her group to break decision-making rules to generate perceived benefits for the group and/or others external to the organization, (2) provides insights into the mechanisms by which rule breaking persists, and (3) highlights the norms of developing and perpetuating groups\u2019 breaking decision-making rules.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021508"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56007455500", "authid": "56007455500", "authname": "Johansson J.", "surname": "Johansson", "given-name": "Jeaneth", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007183"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022085"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55011606700", "authid": "55011606700", "authname": "Malmstr\u00f6m M.", "surname": "Malmstr\u00f6m", "given-name": "Malin", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007183"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8662364900", "authid": "8662364900", "authname": "Wincent J.", "surname": "Wincent", "given-name": "Joakim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002505"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027786"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Refugee-entrepreneurs' resilience in the face of substantial and persistent adversity", "first_author": "Shepherd D.A.", "publication_name": "Journal of Business Venturing", "issn": "08839026", "volumn": "35", "page_range": null, "cover_date": "2020-07-01", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbusvent.2019.06.001", "abstract": "People face adverse events in a variety of forms. Some individuals are resilient to adverse events in that they are able to maintain positive functioning while others experience considerable disruption. In explaining heterogeneity in resilience, research has emphasized people's resource endowments and pre-adversity organizing prior to the adverse events as well as people's cognitive and behavioral responses to such events. Therefore, for most resilience studies, adversity is an event. Although it is critically important to understand resilience to these short- to medium-term adverse events, there is a need to understand resilience over an extended period. In this regard, we focus on Palestine refugees who were born in refugee camps and as adults have known nothing other than being a refugee. When it comes to substantial and persistent adversity, entrepreneurial action likely plays a central role in resilience to such adversity. To explore these relationships, we conducted an extensive data-collection effort over 15 months on refugee entrepreneurs (in refugee camps and not in camps), including 110 interviews. We find the importance of direct, indirect, and recursive relationships among actions (i.e., entrepreneurial action and integration activities), multiple identities, and resilience outcomes under conditions of substantial and persistent adversity. Furthermore, we find important differences between refugee entrepreneurs who live in refugee camps and those who live outside these camps\u2014differences in affiliation, language use, and social capital development\u2014which enable those refugee entrepreneurs living outside the refugee camps to achieve resilience outcomes not accessible to those living inside the camps. Overall, this study makes a number of contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, research has investigated resilience in terms of resources, endowments, and capabilities before an adverse event. The implicit assumptions in this research are that capabilities matter and that adversity has a beginning and subsides over time. In this study, we focus on resilience outcomes in the context of refugees facing substantial adversity over a substantial period and extend the capability argument of resilience in the following ways: (1) the \u201csocial\u201d capability for resilience, not as an endowment but created through activities that build a social basis for resilience outcomes, (2) social integration activities are initiated and facilitated by engaging in entrepreneurial action with non-similar others, and (3) resilience outcomes help individuals both engage in integration activities and build a social capability of resilience. Therefore, in the context of substantial and persistent adversity, refugee entrepreneurs need to act in order to build (rather than simply deploy) their social capability for resilience outcomes. Second, resilience has been explored as either a process or as an outcome. In this study, we find that resilience outcomes are both a consequence and an antecedent of entrepreneurial action\u2014a mutually dependent relationship. Specifically, we find the dimensions of resilience outcomes to include proactive problem solving, moral gains as a broader purpose in life, self-reliance, realistic optimism, and multiple sources of belonging. What is interesting is that these outcomes are also important inputs to entrepreneurial action and the resilience process. Finally, there has been an important stream of research on the role of identity in recovery from adversity. We find that refugee entrepreneurs' actions provide a basis for changing the mix of their multiple identities.

These traditional symmetric methods test relationships between proposed independent and dependent variables to explain entrepreneurial phenomena. Symmetric methods require the data to conform to restrictive assumptions, including normally distributed data, symmetric data relationships, and independence of the variables, and these restrictions limit the ability of these methods to deal with some of the complexity of entrepreneurial behavior that we observe. In effect, the complexity of entrepreneurial phenomena exceeds the capability of traditional methods to reflect important aspects of its heterogeneity. Five main issues occur in entrepreneurship that are problematic for traditional symmetric methods, such that these issues have been afforded less research attention. First, the majority of key entrepreneurship variables exhibit highly skewed distributions, rather than being normally distributed around their means, necessitating data manipulation and the elimination of outlier observations, yet the skew and the outliers may be important in understanding the entrepreneurship context. Second, the heterogeneity of entrepreneurial behavior is reflective of inter-case differences amongst entrepreneurs and their ventures, whereas traditional methods are designed to capture the commonalities across all the cases, and necessarily suppress inter-case differences that may be causal for the observed heterogeneity. Third, entrepreneurial phenomena are often characterized by relationship asymmetry, meaning that an antecedent variable may be both positively and negatively associated with the outcome, for different cases. Symmetric methods find the single \u201cnet-effects model\u201d which highlights the dominant relationship found and ignores any minority relationships that lie within the data. Fourth, entrepreneurial outcomes, whether at the individual, firm or institutional level of analysis, tend to be pursued after taking into account the interdependencies between and among the antecedent variables, yet traditional methods explain entrepreneurship phenomenon as the linear additive impact of the antecedent variables considered discretely \u2013 i.e. independently of the effect of other antecedent variables. Finally, we observe entrepreneurs and organizations taking a variety of pathways to entrepreneurial outcomes, yet traditional methods offer a single dominant net-effects explanation. Thus, symmetric methods cannot reveal important aspects of entrepreneurial heterogeneity (because it is not the method's purpose) that we observe in practice. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) provides a method to dig deeper into the data to reveal finer-grained detail about the complexity of entrepreneurial phenomenon. The fsQCA method accommodates data asymmetry, recognizes the potential interdependence of antecedent variables, identifies asymmetric data relationships, and reveals multiple equally-effective pathways to the same outcome, if they exist. FsQCA examines the within-case relationships among the antecedent variables (referred to as conditions), and characterizes cases as having a particular combination of conditions (known as a configuration) that associates with the dependent variable (known as the outcome). It discovers the configuration common to multiple cases who take a particular pathway to a given outcome, as distinct from those who take other pathways to the same outcome. FsQCA is thus complementary to traditional symmetric methods, adding finer-grained detail about entrepreneurial phenomena and providing an empirical basis for abduction, i.e., it can reveal surprising empirical findings to provoke new theory building efforts. In this paper we outline the fsQCA method, demonstrate the additional information this method can provide from a given data set, and provide a comprehensive agenda for future entrepreneurship research where fsQCA can be used to complement traditional methods and thereby provide new information for future theory building. This paper provides motivation for entrepreneurial public policy on multiple fronts, rather than for \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d policies. It similarly suggests that educators can go beyond the notion of the archetypical entrepreneur to encourage entrepreneurship by those who do not fit the classical mold, and that would-be entrepreneurs and investors should recognize that individuals exhibiting a variety of different configurations can act entrepreneurially and potentially achieve entrepreneurial success.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006156507", "authid": "7006156507", "authname": "Douglas E.J.", "surname": "Douglas", "given-name": "Evan J.", "initials": "E.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032987"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021508"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36740097900", "authid": "36740097900", "authname": "Prentice C.", "surname": "Prentice", "given-name": "Catherine", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032987"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

In this paper, we examine whether and how exposure to physical or sexual assault by male partners influences women's decision to initiate a new business when they have access to financing. We collected primary data from rural Bangladesh in collaboration with a microfinance institution that provided small collateral-free loans to a group of married women. We conducted a baseline survey before loan disbursement and then conducted a follow-up survey 12 to 15 months later to collect information on loan usage. We find that women who experienced physical or sexual violence by their husband before receiving a loan are less likely to initiate a new business with their loan than those who did not experience such violence. Exposure to domestic violence obstructs the initiation of new businesses through reduced entrepreneurial self-efficacy and increased fear of business failure.

We take the conceptualization of hybridity one step further by acknowledging that organizations can differ in the relative importance they ascribe to the economic logic vis-\u00e0-vis the social logic and that both the economic and social logics can be held at varying levels of intensity. The main purpose of reconceptualizing the degree of hybridity is to develop a framework for future research.

In this paper, we build on social capital theory to theorize about how compassionate ventures leverage network relationships to identify and mobilize resources. We also explore how differences in these approaches influence the magnitude, speed, and customization of the response, all of which are theorized indicators of the effectiveness of compassion organizing in alleviating suffering. We use structural equation modelling to test our model and find that compassionate ventures with stronger ties to the local community are more likely to bundle (i.e., stretch) resources, which facilitates a speedy, customized, and large magnitude response. In contrast, those with stronger ties outside the local community are more likely to pursue (i.e., chase) new resources, which results in a large magnitude response, but one that is not associated with speed or customization.

We hypothesize that with increasing country familiarity, (a) manager investment of cognitive effort (process) first increases and then decreases, and (b) the likelihood of a country being included for further consideration (outcome) also increases and then decreases. We further hypothesize that the effects of country familiarity are contingent on the managers' international experience. Empirical evidence from verbal protocol analyses of managers provides strong support to our arguments. These findings contribute to the emergent literature on the critical role of cognition in decision making about foreign markets. Manager cognition potentially influences sequential/non-sequential entry decision making, possibly explaining some previously observed exceptions to internationalization process theory. The contingent role of international experience further stresses that the influence of cognition in internationalization decision making is both important and complex, involving, at least, innate cognitive processes, idiosyncratic knowledge, and international experience.

The path to recovery involves escape through identity play and the oscillation between disciplined identity play and identity refinement/validation. The path to dysfunction involves escape though cognitive deconstruction. Regulatory focus is important in distinguishing between those who engage in identity play to generate possible new positive identities (i.e., promotion focus) and those who engage in cognitive dysfunction (i.e., prevention focus).

An attention model of top managers' opportunity beliefs for strategic action", "first_author": "Shepherd D.A.", "publication_name": "Strategic Management Journal", "issn": "01432095", "volumn": "38", "page_range": "626-644", "cover_date": "2017-03-01", "doi": "10.1002/smj.2499", "abstract": "Research summary: Exploiting opportunities is critical to a firm's competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, there has been considerable interest in the processes by which top managers allocate attention to potential opportunities. Although such investigations have largely focused on top-down processes for allocating attention to the environment, some studies have explored bottom-up processes. In this article, we consider both top-down and bottom-up processing to develop a model by which top managers form opportunity beliefs for strategic action depending on the allocation of transient and sustained attention. Specifically, this attentional model provides insights into how a top manager's attention is allocated to identify potential opportunities from environmental change and explores how different modes of attentional engagement impact the likelihood of forming beliefs about radical and incremental opportunities requiring strategic action. Managerial summary: Managers are interested in noticing and exploiting opportunities because the exploitation of an opportunity represents an important strategic action. Noticing and exploiting opportunities depends on how and where top managers allocate their attention. Managers can focus attention based on their knowledge and experience or as a result of something in the environment capturing their attention. In this paper, we consider both knowledge-driven and environment-driven processes for allocating attention to form opportunity beliefs. This opportunity belief arises from a two stage process. The first stage explains how a top manager identifies environmental changes as potential opportunities. The second stage explains how the top manager forms a belief that these identified environmental changes represent a radical or incremental opportunity worthy of exploitation.

We investigate the speed of opportunity-evaluation decisions by focusing on firms' venture termination and venture advancement decisions. Experience, standard operating procedures, and confidence allow firms to make opportunity-evaluation decisions faster; we propose that a firm's attentional orientation, as reflected in its project portfolio, limits the number of domains in which these speed-enhancing mechanisms can be developed. Hence, firms' decision speed is likely to vary between different types of decisions. Using unique data on 3,269 mineral exploration ventures in the Australian mining industry, we find that firms with a higher degree of attention toward earlier-stage exploration activities are quicker to abandon potential opportunities in early development but slower to do so later, and that such firms are also slower to advance on potential opportunities at all stages compared to firms that focus their attention differently. Market dynamism moderates these relationships, but only with regard to initial evaluation decisions. Our study extends research on decision speed by showing that firms are not necessarily fast or slow regarding all the decisions they make, and by offering an opportunity-evaluation framework that recognizes that decision makers can-in fact, often do-pursue multiple potential opportunities simultaneously.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25822126000", "authid": "25822126000", "authname": "Bakker R.M.", "surname": "Bakker", "given-name": "Rene M.", "initials": "R.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Recent research explores entrepreneurial action as a vehicle for personal transformation and development for the individual, especially as it pertains to overcoming adversity. We build on this emerging literature by exploring victims creating new ventures in the aftermath of a disaster event, where widespread adversity threatens entire communities. Following the disaster, some victim resources are destroyed (e.g., property) while others remain (e.g., human capital) at varying levels. We build on organizational emergence and conservation of resources theories and use structural equation modeling to test a victim entrepreneur model of functioning through the creation of ventures to alleviate others' suffering. We find that venture creation mediates the positive relationship between human capital and functioning and that for those who do not create ventures, human capital is negatively related to functioning-highlighting the important role of venture creation for the victim-actor following a disaster event.

In a study of 2,048 decisions made by 64 CEOs of technology firms, we examine how both metacognitive experience and perceptions of the external environment (hostility and dynamism) could affect the extent to which managers make erratic strategic decisions. The results indicate that managers with greater metacognitive experience make less erratic strategic decisions. The results also indicate that in hostile environments managers make more erratic strategic decisions. But contrary to our expectations, in dynamic environments managers make less erratic strategic decisions.

The model proposes that different types of passion can trigger managers' exploitation decisions but that this effect is contingent on experiencing excitement from events outside their work environment. Afield experiment with 90 owner-managers of young firms located in an innovation context (business incubators) shows that passion for work and nonwork-related excitement levels interdependently impact innovation managers' decision to exploit new product opportunities. Specifically, harmonious passion has a general positive effect on managers' propensity to exploit. In contrast, the effect of obsessive passion is more complex and contingent on the additional excitement managers experience such that the positive relationship between obsessive passion and the decision to exploit is more positive with higher levels of excitement. These findings extend the product innovation management literature by acknowledging that decision-makers' affective experiences influence innovation decisions and provide a first step toward understanding the role of affect and passion in the product innovation context. Second, the finding that obsessive passion and nonwork-related excitement interact in explaining opportunity exploitation decisions highlights the need to incorporate contingency relationships in models ofinnovation decision-making. Third, in drawing on afield experiment and the experimental manipulation of managerial affect during the decision-making task, this article answers a recent call in the project management literature to pursue less common methodological approaches and develop \"broader theoretical schema\" in order to enhance our understanding of innovation management. Finally, this study also has implications for practitioners because it can help innovation managers understand their own decision policies. To the extent that innovation managers are able to regulate their affective experiences, this improved understanding might prevent them from premature and faulty decision-making.", "aggregation_type": "Book", "subtype": "ch", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48761624500", "authid": "48761624500", "authname": "Klaukien A.", "surname": "Klaukien", "given-name": "Anja", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019722"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019722"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23028702200", "authid": "23028702200", "authname": "Patzelt H.", "surname": "Patzelt", "given-name": "Holger", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019722"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Integrating theoretical work on the nature of entrepreneurial opportunities with cog- nitive science research on the use of similarity comparisons in making creative mental leaps, we develop a model of opportunity identification that includes both the inde- pendent effects of an opportunity idea's similarity characteristics and the interaction of these characteristics with an individual's knowledge and motivation.

The model proposes that different types of passion can trigger managers' exploitation decisions but that this effect is contingent on experiencing excitement from events outside their work environment. Afield experiment with 90 owner-managers of young firms located in an innovation context (business incubators) shows that passion for work and non work-related excitement levels interdependently impact innovation managers' decision to exploit new product opportunities. Specifically, harmonious passion has a general positive effect on managers\u2019 propensity to exploit. In contrast, the effect of obsessive passion is more complex and contingent on the additional excitement managers experience such that the positive relationship between obsessive passion and the decision to exploit is more positive with higher levels of excitement. These findings extend the product innovation management literature by acknowledging that decision-makers\u2019 affective experiences influence innovation decisions and provide a first step toward understanding the role of affect and passion in the product innovation context. Second, the finding that obsessive passion and non work-related excitement interact in explaining opportunity exploitation decisions highlights the need to incorporate contingency relationships in models of innovation decision-making. Third, in drawing on afield experiment and the experimental manipulation of managerial affect during the decision-making task, this article answers a recent call in the project management literature to pursue less common methodological approaches and develop \u201cbroader theoretical schema\u201d in order to enhance our understanding of innovation management. Finally, this study also has implications for practitioners because it can help innovation managers understand their own decision policies.

Building on moral self-regulation theory (Bandura, 1991), we propose that entrepreneurs' assessments of the attractiveness of opportunities that harm the natural environment depend on the simultaneous impact of values and personal agency. By cognitively disengaging their pro-environmental values, decision makers (i.e., entrepreneurs) can (under certain circumstances) perceive opportunities that harm the environment as highly attractive and thus suitable for exploitation. The results of a judgment task that generated 1,264 opportunity assessments nested within 83 business founders offered support for this general prediction and indicated that the extent of founders' disengagement of their pro-environmental values was stronger when they had high, rather than low, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and stronger when industry munificence was perceived as low rather than high.

We demonstrate that these conditions not only depend on the effect of industry age on the follower's complementary asset characteristics, but also on both a direct and indirect effect of industry age on performance. Specifically, we show that a high degree of relatedness in the follower's complementary assets does not necessarily afford the opportunity to wait, as the ability to wait depends on whether these direct and indirect effects are weakened or intensified by the strength of the relatedness. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102530743", "authid": "7102530743", "authname": "L\u00e9vesque M.", "surname": "L\u00e9vesque", "given-name": "Moren", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60119111"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602641745", "authid": "6602641745", "authname": "Minniti M.", "surname": "Minniti", "given-name": "Maria", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60118346"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

The model proposes that different types of passion can trigger managers' exploitation decisions but that this effect is contingent on experiencing excitement from events outside their work environment. A field experiment with 90 owner-managers of young firms located in an innovation context (business incubators) shows that passion for work and nonwork-related excitement levels interdependently impact innovation managers' decision to exploit new product opportunities. Specifically, harmonious passion has a general positive effect on managers' propensity to exploit. In contrast, the effect of obsessive passion is more complex and contingent on the additional excitement managers experience such that the positive relationship between obsessive passion and the decision to exploit is more positive with higher levels of excitement. These findings extend the product innovation management literature by acknowledging that decision-makers' affective experiences influence innovation decisions and provide a first step toward understanding the role of affect and passion in the product innovation context. Second, the finding that obsessive passion and nonwork-related excitement interact in explaining opportunity exploitation decisions highlights the need to incorporate contingency relationships in models of innovation decision-making. Third, in drawing on a field experiment and the experimental manipulation of managerial affect during the decision-making task, this article answers a recent call in the project management literature to pursue less common methodological approaches and develop \"broader theoretical schema\" in order to enhance our understanding of innovation management. Finally, this study also has implications for practitioners because it can help innovation managers understand their own decision policies. To the extent that innovation managers are able to regulate their affective experiences, this improved understanding might prevent them from premature and faulty decision-making. \u00a9 2013 Product Development & Management Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/48761624500", "authid": "48761624500", "authname": "Klaukien A.", "surname": "Klaukien", "given-name": "Anja", "initials": "A."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021121"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23028702200", "authid": "23028702200", "authname": "Patzelt H.", "surname": "Patzelt", "given-name": "Holger", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019722"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

The purpose of this article is to review research on life after business failure for entrepreneurs, from the immediate aftermath through to recovery and re-emergence. First, the authors examine the financial, social, and psychological costs of failure, highlighting factors that may influence the magnitude of these costs (including individual responses to managing these costs). Second, they review research that explains how entrepreneurs make sense of and learn from failure. Finally, the authors present research on the outcomes of business failure, including recovery as well as cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

Integrating theoretical work on the nature of entrepreneurial opportunities with cognitive science research on the use of similarity comparisons in making creative mental leaps, we develop a model of opportunity identification that includes both the independent effects of an opportunity idea's similarity characteristics and the interaction of these characteristics with an individual's knowledge and motivation. We test this model with a within-subject experiment in which we asked two samples of entrepreneurs to form beliefs about opportunity ideas for technology transfer. Results indicate that the superficial and structural similarities of technology-market combinations impact the formation of opportunity beliefs and that individual differences in prior knowledge and entrepreneurial intent moderate these relationships. In addition to casting light on cognitive reasons why some entrepreneurial opportunities may be more or less difficult to identify, our theorizing and findings point toward reasoning strategies that may facilitate the identification of multiple (and potentially more valuable) opportunities, not only for new technologies, but also for new products, services, and/or business models. \u00a9 Academy of Management Journal.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13002542300", "authid": "13002542300", "authname": "Gr\u00e9goire D.A.", "surname": "Gr\u00e9goire", "given-name": "Denis A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60118346"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021121"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Using a cohort panel of 951 new manufacturing firms over nine years, our findings provide evidence for the importance of financial slack resources in understanding opportunity generation and also for reconciling theoretical arguments regarding the slack resource-performance link. We find that while financial slack does provide buffering capacity (in hostile and dynamic environments), and flexibility for experimentation (in munificent and dynamic environments) as suggested by prior theory, the most positive relationship between financial slack and performance for new firms was in low discretion environments (hostile and stable environments) - where firms need to develop their own opportunities.

In this study, we adopt a psychological perspective of judgment to investigate managers' erratic strategic decisions, which we define as a manager's inconsistent judgments that can shape the direction of the firm. In a study of 2,048 decisions made by 64 CEOs of technology firms, we examine how both metacognitive experience and perceptions of the external environment (hostility and dynamism) could affect the extent to which managers make erratic strategic decisions. The results indicate that managers with greater metacognitive experience make less erratic strategic decisions. The results also indicate that in hostile environments managers make more erratic strategic decisions. But contrary to our expectations, in dynamic environments managers make less erratic strategic decisions. Similarly, hostility and dynamism interact in their effect on erratic strategic decisions in that the positive relationship between environmental hostility and erratic strategic decisions will be less positive for managers experiencing high environmental dynamism than those experiencing low environmental dynamism. These results have important implications for strategic decision-making research. \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35609026200", "authid": "35609026200", "authname": "Robert Mitchell J.", "surname": "Robert Mitchell", "given-name": "J.", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60115928"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603579925", "authid": "6603579925", "authname": "Sharfman M.P.", "surname": "Sharfman", "given-name": "Mark P.", "initials": "M.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116547"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Our study highlights obstacles to future employment that are counterintuitive and stem from the discontinuous and traumatic nature of job loss. Effective management of this type of transitioning appears to stem from efforts positioned to formulate a coherent narrative of the traumatic experience and thus to reconstruct foundational assumptions about the world, humanity, and self.

Using a sample of over 30,000 companies followed during their first 7 years of existence, we find evidence that financial indicators mitigate the liability of newness and that this buffering effect is stronger the younger the organization. These results represent three primary contributions to the literature. First, our conceptualization of accounting measures as indicators of external (creditworthiness enhancing legitimacy) as well as internal (targets for management) buffers to the liabilities of newness provides a novel way of viewing these constructs and explains why they are important to new firms despite their uncertainty and opacity. Second, we theoretically justify and empirically validate that these constructs are more important the younger the new firm is, which runs counter to the common wisdom of these constructs in the entrepreneurship literature.

But how do business leaders do that concretely? Organization research shows that managers are more inclined to identify threats than opportunities, but it is still not clear why this is the case. Likewise, research points to several factors that may facilitate the recognition of opportunities. Yet empirical observations have been limited by retrospective biases and other conceptual challenges. As a result, key questions remain not only about what factors facilitate the recognition of opportunities, but also about why these factors play such a role. To further understanding of these issues, we study the reasoning strategies that individuals mobilize for recognizing opportunities. We develop a model of opportunity recognition as a cognitive process of structural alignment, and analyze the think-aloud verbalizations of executive entrepreneurs as they try to recognize opportunities for new technologies. In contrast to prior research, the qualitative and quantitative data do not provide evidence that individuals use prototypes to recognize opportunities. Instead, we find that different kinds of mental connections play different roles in the process of recognizing opportunities, with different consequences. We also document why and how prior knowledge may facilitate this process. By drawing attention to the cognitive underpinnings of opportunity recognition, we cast light on why it constitutes such a challenging task for individuals and organizations. In turn, this provides a useful basis for exploring the factors that explain why some individuals/organizations are able to recognize opportunities that others simply fail to see. \u00a9 2010 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13002542300", "authid": "13002542300", "authname": "Gr\u00e9goire D.A.", "surname": "Gr\u00e9goire", "given-name": "Denis A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60098091"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102507692", "authid": "7102507692", "authname": "Barr P.S.", "surname": "Barr", "given-name": "Pamela S.", "initials": "P.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60098091"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Doing so, the authors contribute an integrated method to address conceptual and methodological issues that have hindered prior research on opportunity recognition, and thereby enable more rigorous investigations of this important activity. \u00a9 2010 SAGE Publications.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13002542300", "authid": "13002542300", "authname": "Gr\u00e9goire D.A.", "surname": "Gr\u00e9goire", "given-name": "Denis A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60098091"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12789426300", "authid": "12789426300", "authname": "Lambert L.S.", "surname": "Lambert", "given-name": "Lisa Schurer", "initials": "L.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60098091"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

We do this by drawing on the self-representation literature and the decision-making literature to introduce two distinct types of images of self: images of vulnerability and images of capability. In a study of 1936 decisions about hypothetical entrepreneurial opportunities made by 121 executives of technology firms, we then investigate how both types of images of self affect the images of opportunities that underlie opportunity recognition.

Based on an analysis of data from 413 small businesses, we derive a set of propositions that suggest how entrepreneurial orientation, environmental characteristics, firm resources, and managers' personal attitudes directly and/or indirectly influence the growth of small businesses. \u00a9 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23020517900", "authid": "23020517900", "authname": "Wiklund J.", "surname": "Wiklund", "given-name": "Johan", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60104462"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23028702200", "authid": "23028702200", "authname": "Patzelt H.", "surname": "Patzelt", "given-name": "Holger", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "129051166"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

The longer entrepreneurs wait, the more they learn from others. However, by waiting, they reduce their ability to learn directly and the possibility of locking in competitive advantages. We suggest that the optimal time of entry depends on the hostility of the learning environment since the latter has an impact on dimensions of performance, such as profit potential and mortality risk. The environment for entrepreneurial learning is less hostile when the information to be learned is abundant and when learning from others is relatively more effective at increasing performance than learning from participation. Our results suggest that delaying entry is desirable when the environment is less hostile. Entrepreneurs, however, cannot wait forever. We show that, under some general conditions, an optimal time of entry can be determined, and discuss the specific situations in which, instead, multiple equilibria may arise. \u00a9 2009 Baylor University.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102530743", "authid": "7102530743", "authname": "L\u00e9vesque M.", "surname": "L\u00e9vesque", "given-name": "Moren", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60014171"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602641745", "authid": "6602641745", "authname": "Minniti M.", "surname": "Minniti", "given-name": "Maria", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116865"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

We apply boundary and exchange concepts to examine 97 entrepreneurship articles published in leading management journals from 1985 to 1999.

The highly permeable boundaries of entrepreneurship facilitate intellectual exchange with other management areas but sometimes discourage the development of entrepreneurship theory and hinder legitimacy. We argue that focusing entrepreneurship research at the intersection of the constructs of individuals, opportunities, modes of organizing, and the environment will define the field and enhance legitimacy. Decision theory, start-up factors of production, information processing and network theory, and temporal dynamics are put forward for entrepreneurship scholars to explore important research questions in these intersections. \u00a9 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "aggregation_type": "Book", "subtype": "ch", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602167345", "authid": "6602167345", "authname": "Busenitz L.", "surname": "Busenitz", "given-name": "Lowell W.", "initials": "L.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60030931"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201945857", "authid": "7201945857", "authname": "West G.", "surname": "West", "given-name": "G.

We conducted policy-capturing experiments on 119 VCs across three countries, representing distinct economic institutions (US, mature market economy; South Korea, emerging economy; and China, transitional economy). Results show that VCs in rules-based market economies (US) rely upon market information to a greater extent than VCs in emerging economies (Korea), and Chinese VCs (transitional economy) weight human capital factors more heavily than either US or Korean VCs. Findings suggest that, although professional institutions may dictate which information is included in VC decision policies, the extent to which that information is emphasized is determined partly by the economic institution in which the decision-maker operates. \u00a9 2007 Academy of International Business.

Based upon this model we develop expressions for the financial performance of the venture capital process, both overall and also from the perspectives of the entrepreneurs, investors, managers, and venture capitalists involved. For these financial measures we derive the optimal allocation of attention between pre- and post-investment activities, and the optimal proportion of venture proposals to accept. Further analysis shows how these different financial measures and optimal values respond to changes in the business climate. More interestingly, our analysis also shows where and to what extent the different parties could be expected to agree or disagree on how best to manage the process. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the decisions of entrepreneurs to begin exploiting business opportunities from a resource-based view.

Moreover, the findings of this study shed a light on a less emphasized aspect of the resource-based view: the new product's anticipated lead time acts as an enhancing moderator in entrepreneurs' exploitation decision policies.

Thus, the VC decision process has received tremendous attention within the entrepreneurship literature. Yet, most studies on VC decision-making focus on which decision criteria are central to selecting gazelles. Although informative, the majority of these studies has neglected cognitive differences in how VCs make decisions. This is surprising considering the influence cognitive differences are likely to have on the exploitation of an opportunity as well as its influence on likely success. The current study investigates whether VCs are overconfident, as well as the factors surrounding the decision that lead to overconfidence. Overconfidence describes the tendency to overestimate the likely occurrence of a set of events. Overconfident people make probability judgments that are more extreme than they should, given the evidence and their knowledge. In the case of the new venture investment decision, overconfident VCs may overestimate the likelihood that a funded company will succeed. The results of the current study indicate that VCs are indeed overconfident (96% of the 51 participating VCs exhibited significant overconfidence) and that overconfidence negatively affects VC decision accuracy (the correlation between overconfidence and accuracy was 0.70). The level of overconfidence depended upon the amount of information, the type of information, and whether the VC strongly believes the venture will succeed or fail. As more information becomes available, people tend to believe they will make better decisions; they are making a \"more informed decision.\" More information ideally should enable the VCs to assess any potential pitfalls. However, additional information makes the decision more complex. Information factors may contradict and relate to other information in unexpected ways. Even if more information is available, people usually don't analyze all of it (even though they believe they do). Thus, more information creates greater confidence, but it also leads to lower decision accuracy. The type of information that is available also impacts overconfidence and decision accuracy. VCs are intuitive decision makers. When people are familiar with a decision and the structure of the information surrounding that decision, they resort to automatic information processing. On the other hand, if information surrounding the decision is structured in an unfamiliar way, people need to decipher what each piece of information means and how that impacts their overall accuracy. In the case of expert VCs, that means they must deviate from their intuitive style. It seems that forcing them outside their \"comfort zone\" has a negative effect on their confidence and has an even greater effect (negative) on their accuracy. There is evidence of an \"availability bias\" in VC decision-making; VCs rely on how well the current decision matches past successful or failed investments. VCs are overconfident in their prediction of venture success when they predict a very high level of success. VCs are also overconfident in their prediction of venture failure when they predict a very low likelihood of success. This high level of overconfidence in success predictions (or failure predictions) may encourage the VC to limit information search and fund a lower potential investment (or prematurely reject a stronger potential investment). Although overconfidence in itself does not necessarily lead to a wrong decision, the bias is likely to inhibit learning and improving the decision process. Overconfident VCs may not fully consider all relevant information, nor search for additional information to improve their decision. Moreover, the natural tendency for people to recall past successes rather than failures may mean that VCs will make the same mistakes again. VCs can take simple steps to reduce the effect of overconfidence, including counterfactual thinking (i.e., imaging scenarios where current assumptions might not hold), formally recording how past decisions were made at the time of the decision (versus trying to recall how that decision was made from memory), and using actuarial decision aids that decompose decisions into core components. Reducing overconfidence may lead to stronger decisions. It is hoped that this study illustrates the power of cognitive theories for understanding VC decision-making. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602643154", "authid": "6602643154", "authname": "Zacharakis A.", "surname": "Zacharakis", "given-name": "Andrew L.", "initials": "A.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025239"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000221"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

Specifically, the study investigates the types of information venture capitalists utilize when evaluating new ventures and how venture capitalists use this information to assess likely new venture profitability. In the interest of advancing our understanding of the decision making policies of venture capitalists, this study addresses many of the limitations of previous research. A review of IO research suggests important relationships between a number of strategy variables and new venture profitability. Some of the relationships proposed by IO strategy research are contingent in nature. The strategy variables and their relationships with profitability are investigated in the domain of venture capitalists' decision making. Individual and aggregate decision making analyses identified those strategy variables (criteria) venture capitalists utilize in assessing likely new venture profitability, namely, timing, key success factor stability, lead time, competitive rivalry, educational capability, industry-related competence, timing \u00d7 key success factor stability interaction, timing \u00d7 lead time interaction, and timing \u00d7 educational capability interaction. On average, the most important criterion for venture capitalists in their assessment of profitability is industry-related competence. The second tier of importance is competitive rivalry, timing, and educational capability. The third tier of importance is lead time, key success factor stability, and timing \u00d7 lead time interaction. Other interactions are less important. Therefore, while venture capitalists use contingent decision policies, main effects dominate. If venture capitalists use a reported 8 to 12 minutes on average to evaluate a business plan (Sandberg 1986), then this study's findings may help the inexperienced venture capitalist allocate time towards assessing those attributes of primary importance. Although more complex relationships exist between the attributes, the inexperienced venture capitalist can take comfort from this study's findings that main effects dominant amongst senior venture capitalists. Senior venture capitalists may take less comfort from their importance placed on main effects in light of research from IO, which suggests the importance of contingent relationships. The results may also have practical application towards training. How should venture capital firms train their new employees? Should venture capital firms rely solely on experienced venture capitalists lecturing the inexperienced on the criteria they use in assessing a new venture proposal? Like most decision makers, venture capitalists have limited insight into their assessments and venture capital firms need to be aware of the gap between \"espoused\" policies and policies \"in use.\" The information being taught needs to be supplemented with venture capitalists' decision-making research that investigates decision policies \"in use\", such as this study. Venture capitalist training could also involve experiential learning, in conjunction with cognitive feedback about the decision policies used, to accelerate the learning process. Experiential learning using cognitive feedback maximizes industry related learning while minimizing the cost of inexperienced decisions. For the entrepreneur seeking capital, this increased understanding of venture capitalists' decision making may help them better target their business plans and presentations at those criteria venture capitalists' find most critical to the profitability of a new venture. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000221"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6508235731", "authid": "6508235731", "authname": "Ettenson R.", "surname": "Ettenson", "given-name": "Richard", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "129993538"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24392514700", "authid": "24392514700", "authname": "Crouch A.", "surname": "Crouch", "given-name": "Andrew", "initials": "A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60031602"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

This emphasis is in part a reflection of the perils of newness but also stems from the retrospective and aggregate perspective taken by researchers. Although the macro-level perspective of new venture mortality has made a significant contribution to our knowledge of mortality risk patterns, there has been little interest in identifying how venture managers can address the risks that all new organizations face. We argue that in order to make progress in explaining new venture survival, a theoretical model is required that uses a more micro-level perspective to explain new venture failure (and the flip side, new venture survival). In this paper we develop such a model. We establish a definition of mortality risk and argue that the liability of newness is largely dependent on the degree of novelty (ignorance) associated with a new venture. Novelty is viewed in three different dimensions, viz.: to the market, to the technology of production and to management. Novelty to the market concerns the degree to which the customers are uncertain about the new venture. Novelty in production concerns the extent to which the production technology used by the new venture is similar to the technologies in which the production team has experience and knowledge. Novelty to management concerns the entrepreneurial team's lack of business skills, industry specific information and start-up experience. We argue that mortality risk increases with the degree of novelty in each dimension and with the number of dimensions in which the new venture is novel. We propose that the decline in mortality risk occurs as the venture's novelty in each of the three dimensions is eroded by information search and dissemination processes. This allows the new firm to become an established business and explains what we term the \"evolutionary\" path of mortality - novelty and risk decline monotonically, after a period of adolescence, as ignorance decays over time due to 'passive learning'. We also propose that there is a \"strategic\" mortality risk path that reflects the impact of positive and negative shocks (shocks are exogenous events that alter the overall degree of novelty at a point in time - positive shocks decrease overall novelty, while negative shocks increase overall novelty) and reversals (endogenous actions that increase the overall novelty of the new venture at a point in time) on the mortality risk of a new venture. If the incidence and effects of these disruptions can be managed, then venture managers may be able to mitigate the mortality risk for their venture. We argue that risk reduction strategies can be employed, most of which impact on one or more of the dimensions of mortality risk in order to increase the firm's chances of survival. A series of risk reduction strategies are proposed and their impact on the determinants of mortality risk is considered. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000221"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006156507", "authid": "7006156507", "authname": "Douglas E.J.", "surname": "Douglas", "given-name": "Evan J.", "initials": "E.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011019"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603680970", "authid": "6603680970", "authname": "Shanley M.", "surname": "Shanley", "given-name": "Mark", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007363"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

This paper contributes to the latter investigation, and specifically asks why some people choose to be entrepreneurs, while others choose to be employees. Responding to prior literature recognizing the lack of a coherent theory of entrepreneurship and calling for a rigorous examination of the decision to become an entrepreneur, this paper presents an economic model of the career decision. We postulate that the individual chooses an entrepreneurial career path, or a career as an employee, or some combination of the two, according to which career path promises maximal utility (or psychic satisfaction). We assume that the individual's utility from any particular occupation, whether self-employed or employed, depends on income (which depends in turn on ability), as well as working conditions such as decision-making control, risk exposure, work effort required, and other working conditions (net perquisites) associated with that occupation. Individuals will exhibit either preference or aversion towards each of the specified working conditions, and it is the degree of that preference or aversion, in conjunction with the quantum of each working condition, which determines the total utility that the individual will derive from each particular occupation. We show that all employees will have an incentive to be self-employed (if they could assemble the same resources as their employer). Also, the greater their managerial and entrepreneurial ability, the greater will be their incentive to be self-employed, other things being equal. Next, we show that a more positive attitude to work (i.e., a lesser aversion to work effort required) provides a greater incentive to be self-employed. The individual's degree of risk aversion also influences the choice to be an entrepreneur. The more tolerant one is of risk bearing, the greater the incentive to be self-employed. Similarly, the greater the preference for independence, or decision-making control, the greater the incentive to be self-employed. Finally, it is noted that perquisites (and avoidance of irksome elements) can potentially be controlled to a greater degree when self-employed, so the individual will consider the differences in these other working conditions when contemplating a career choice. But it is the sum of the utility and disutility from these sources which determines the career decision. Thus, we demonstrate that positive attitudes toward risk, work, and independence are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for a person to want to be an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial abilities and attitudes are desirable in employment situations, therefore, an employer may choose to bribe an entrepreneurial individual to be an employee by offering more income and greater independence, for example. We demonstrate that firms recruiting employees, or venture capitalists considering funding an entrepreneur, should in their own best interests investigate the person's attitudes toward income, risk, work, and independence as well as their abilities, as these attitudes underpin the person's worth as an employee and their incentive to be self-employed. Management educators should design programs which enhance the entrepreneurial abilities and attitudes of individuals, and the individuals themselves should consider their 'attitudinal' make-up before committing to entrepreneurship. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006156507", "authid": "7006156507", "authname": "Douglas E.J.", "surname": "Douglas", "given-name": "Evan J.", "initials": "E.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011019"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201684101", "authid": "7201684101", "authname": "Shepherd D.A.", "surname": "Shepherd", "given-name": "Dean A.", "initials": "D.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000221"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7201684101"}

To leverage this resource adequately, organisations must encourage their employees to share what they know with their peers. Enterprise social media (ESM) has emerged as an ideal venue for achieving this goal, and numerous studies have examined the drivers of work-related knowledge contributions on these platforms. The present study contributes to this body of research by examining a prevalent yet underexplored form of knowledge sharing that often occurs on ESM: nonwork-related knowledge contributions. We argue that contrary to a commonly held belief, this presumably hedonic employee behaviour can benefit organisations through its spillover effect on the work domain. In other words, we argue that nonwork-related knowledge contributions on ESM can foster work-related ones. Building on social exchange theory and on the associative\u2013propositional evaluation model in social psychology, we also show that the employee\u2013employer (EE) relationship\u2014conceptualised in terms of perceived organisational support and perceived employee psychological safety\u2014moderates the relationship between the two forms of knowledge contributions. The analysis of field data collected from 269 employees of a French e-commerce company confirmed that nonwork-related knowledge contributions are positively associated with work-related ones and that this positive association is moderated by the EE relationship.

However, our knowledge is limited when it comes to explaining how ESM integrates the media portfolio and the extent to which it can or cannot replace email use. Adopting a grounded methodology, we conducted a case study in a large multinational corporation specialized in the beauty and well-being sector, in which we found that ESM superimposes the existing media and thus creates a millefeuille effect. Grounded in our case study, we explain the millefeuille effect in the specific case of ESM over email and develop a revised version of the millefeuille theory. Our findings show that the millefeuille effect emerges from negotiation between the perceived affordances enabled by ESM and its imposed constraints, and from that of email with regard to communication norms and routines and the context of IT use. The results highlight the need for managerial engagement in ESM that goes beyond its sponsorship alone. Our study revisits the millefeuille theory by adopting three theoretical lenses to explain the millefeuille effect: a media portfolio features lens, a norm and communication routine lens, and a context-of-IT-use lens. We contribute to the IS literature by proposing a revised version of the millefeuille theory that integrates the affordance lens.

Highlighting the importance of incorporating ORAs into the broader context of relationship management that integrates ethics as fairness and not only ethics as honesty serves to illustrate why the future of ORAs might not be as bright as predicted by a theoretical interpretation of the technology that is sometimes disconnected from the realities of the field. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24329049100", "authid": "24329049100", "authname": "Charki M.H.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Mohamed H\u00e9di", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60109562"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55488731600", "authid": "55488731600", "authname": "Charki N.B.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Nabila Boukef", "initials": "N.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60102126"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "24329049100"}

Online reverse auctions thus provide fertile ground for the study of ethical issues in virtual settings, particularly as there has been little investigation of these issues by the IS community. We adopted a qualitative approach based on a narrative study of a major French retailer and its suppliers. We held seventy interviews with three groups of informants (technology initiators, buyers and suppliers) to explore how these actors interpret and deal with the unethical use of the technology. Our main findings reveal that while there is a consensus on broad ethical criteria, divergences remain about how specific behaviors are interpreted as ethical or non-ethical.

Nevertheless, the introduction of online reverse auctions (ORA) in the negotiation process has been perceived as a resource that decreases inter-organizational trust, limiting the possibilities of collaboration. Online reverse auctions enable buyers to achieve tremendous financial savings through a considerable decrease in suppliers' margins and profits. Consequently, online reverse auctions are blamed for destroying buyer-supplier trust and creating distrust among suppliers toward buyers. Indeed, there is a widespread perception among suppliers that online reverse auctions are unfair since they only take buyers' interests into consideration, increasing the suppliers' suspicion of buyer opportunism. Suppliers feel that online reverse auctions tend to undermine relationships, and they feel exploited by the process, consequently reducing their level of trust in buyers. This paper focuses on the outcomes of ORA use in the business relationships of one major French retailer and its industrial suppliers. Based on a case study built upon 70 semi-directive interviews, we propose an analysis of the impact of ORA use in business relationships. We show that it is not the technology of ORA itself which is responsible for trust deterioration but the way it is used.

The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and usability of using domestic-scale 3D food printer as an assistive technology to print pureed food into attractive food shapes for people with dysphagia. Materials and Methods: In total, 16 participants engaged in the unfamiliar, novel process of using a domestic-scale 3D food printer (choosing, printing, tasting), designed for printing pureed food, and discussed their impressions in focus group or individual interviews. Results and Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrated that informed experts who were novice users perceived the 3D food printing process to be fun but time consuming, and that 3D food printers might not yet be suitable for people with dysphagia or their supporters. Slow response time, lack of user feedback, scant detail on the appropriate recipes for the pureed food to create a successful print, and small font on the user panel interface were perceived as barriers to accessibility for people with disability and older people. Participants expected more interactive elements and feedback from the device, particularly in relation to resolving printer or user errors. This study will inform future usability trials and food safety research into 3D printed foods for people with disability and dysphagia. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION 3D food printers potentially have a role as an assistive technology in the preparation of texture-modified foods for people with disability and dysphagia. To increase feasibility, 3D food printers should be co-designed with people with disability and their supporters and health professionals working in the field of dysphagia and rehabilitation. Experts struggled to be able to print 3D pureed shapes owing to relatively low usability of the 3D food printer tested with problems using the interface and resolving problems in the print. 3D food printing is a fun and novel activity and may help to engage people with disability and dysphagia in making choices around the shape of the food to be printed.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801346687", "authid": "7801346687", "authname": "Hemsley B.", "surname": "Hemsley", "given-name": "Bronwyn", "initials": "B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25421514900", "authid": "25421514900", "authname": "Dann S.", "surname": "Dann", "given-name": "Stephen", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008950"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57685612400", "authid": "57685612400", "authname": "Reddacliff C.", "surname": "Reddacliff", "given-name": "Courtney", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212994934", "authid": "57212994934", "authname": "Smith R.", "surname": "Smith", "given-name": "Rebecca", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14121166200", "authid": "14121166200", "authname": "Given F.", "surname": "Given", "given-name": "Fiona", "initials": "F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15126782000", "authid": "15126782000", "authname": "Gay V.", "surname": "Gay", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55234419400", "authid": "55234419400", "authname": "Leong T.W.", "surname": "Leong", "given-name": "Tuck Wah", "initials": "T.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195457613", "authid": "57195457613", "authname": "Skellern K.", "surname": "Skellern", "given-name": "Katrina", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "10", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57967424800", "authid": "57967424800", "authname": "Bull C.", "surname": "Bull", "given-name": "Chriss", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "11", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55516694300", "authid": "55516694300", "authname": "Palmer S.", "surname": "Palmer", "given-name": "Stuart", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "122554109"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "12", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203104315", "authid": "57203104315", "authname": "Balandin S.", "surname": "Balandin", "given-name": "Susan", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018805"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

In this paper, the authors address this gap by conducting a configurational analysis to develop an integrative taxonomy of social media-enabled strategies for open innovation. This analysis stems from the integration of internal and external variables such as social media communication activities, organizational innovation seekers, potential innovation providers, the stages of the open innovation process, and their relationship with different performance outcomes and barriers to social media adoption for open innovation. Through an empirical study of 337 firms based in eight countries, four clusters have been identified that are characterized as distinct strategies: \u201cmarketing semi-open innovators,\u201d \u201ccross-department semi-open innovators,\u201d \u201ccross-department full process semi-open innovators\u201d and \u201cbroad adopters open innovators.\u201d The findings reveal the trade-offs associated with different strategies for implementing social media for open innovation and provide insights of the use of these strategies. By doing so, they suggest a more nuanced approach that contrasts with the traditionally positive (or even rosy) depiction of the effects of social media on open innovation. Accordingly, managers are encouraged to contemplate their organizational competencies, capabilities, and their strategic intent when drafting social media strategies for open innovation. Selective approaches, along with greater adoption leading to greater benefits, are shown to be more rewarding than a middle way that spreads things too thin.

Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP) perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in online community-based OI. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an exploratory case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage with online user communities on the intermediary\u2019s platform. Results incorporate both the intermediary and clients\u2019 perspective, based on analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients\u2019 online community projects and other archival data. Findings: Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge boundary management mechanisms \u2013 syntactic, semantic and pragmatic \u2013 each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively, and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at the organization\u2013community boundary. The findings show that the pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms, and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge collaboration in community-based OI settings. Practical implications: The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value: Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55523208900", "authid": "55523208900", "authname": "Randhawa K.", "surname": "Randhawa", "given-name": "Krithika", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35318747600", "authid": "35318747600", "authname": "Schweitzer J.", "surname": "Schweitzer", "given-name": "Jochen", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35799878200", "authid": "35799878200", "authname": "Logue D.", "surname": "Logue", "given-name": "Danielle", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Based on multiple interviews with the employees of the global commodity firm Gamma Chemical (around 50,000 employees), the research aims at gaining an understanding of the contextual conditions required to successfully build and leverage individuals\u2019 external social client network ties for business unit ambidexterity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a single-case study at Gamma Chemical that entailed 33 semi-directive interviews, each of which lasted 1-4 h, at different organizational levels (ranging from top-level management to production workers). We had access to three regional business units. The interviews addressed the links between the individuals in the business units and external actors. The authors also collected information about the company\u2019s strategic objectives, the local competitive environment and work organization. Open-ended questions were used to allow the interviewees to freely relate anecdotes about their own network development. In particular, the authors asked the respondents to identify business contacts with whom they interacted privately and to describe the relationships. Findings: The research findings are two-fold. First, and contrary to prior studies, the authors find that individuals\u2019 social capital contributes to both exploration and exploitation at the business unit level. Second, developing and leveraging individuals\u2019 external social capital requires a specific organizational context at the business unit level that allows employees to develop and nurture their personal business relationships with clients. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by the scope of the sample (a study of one large multinational firm). Further research conducted in similar contexts may therefore be useful for comparability purposes and to generalize the results. Practical implications: Several practical recommendations describe how managers can effectively make use of their employees\u2019 social connections with clients. In particular, the results suggest that managers should seek business unit flexibility on the basis of team-based structures, an autonomous leadership style and by actively creating a degree of critical social network tie redundancy, encouraging a shared network culture. These three specific conditions allow employees\u2019 personal client networks to not only flourish but also contribute to business unit ambidexterity. Originality/value: Prior social capital studies have analyzed intra-firm and inter-firm relationships in terms of contributing to firm ambidexterity. However, these findings have often been difficult to translate into specific organizational levels. Given business units\u2019 critical role in identifying and implementing business opportunities for a firm, the authors focus on the micro-foundations of exploratory and exploitative learning by using a social capital perspective to explore the link between employees\u2019 private external social relationships with clients and business unit ambidexterity.

This idea that nostalgia is a social emotion has notably been leveraged in marketing, and is discussed in the related literature (see, for example, Cutcher, 2008; Kessous and Roux, 2008), but there is no discussion of the media aspect.

If these remain unanswered, the Foucauldian approach could be relegated to a self-contradictory, ultra-relativist and partial reading grid of 'reality'. In this article, we develop a Nietzschean reading of Foucault's thinking that offers answers to these criticisms, and reinstates it as an independent philosophical project grounded in epistemological assumptions that are coherent with its ontology and methodology. Finally, we suggest that, following Nietzsche, the whole Foucauldian project can be approached as a genealogy of morals. Subsequently, we call on scholars to further explore the 'third generation' of Foucauldian studies which would study management practices as morals understood as an 'art de vivre'. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032545"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

We show the extent to which lobbying, rumor, technical problems, and public discourse can impact on the interpretations of the technology regarding ethics. Highlighting the importance of incorporating ORAs into the broader context of relationship management that integrates ethics as fairness and not only ethics as honesty serves to illustrate why the future of ORAs might not be as bright as predicted by a theoretical interpretation of the technology that is sometimes disconnected from the realities of the field. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24329049100", "authid": "24329049100", "authname": "Charki M.H.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Mohamed H\u00e9di", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60109562"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55488731600", "authid": "55488731600", "authname": "Charki N.B.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Nabila Boukef", "initials": "N.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60102126"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

The paper seeks to understand why DGBL is constantly developing despite this lack of consensus about the learning outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the motivations for DGBL adoption and implementation beyond pedagogical ones, the authors use organizational theories to propose a three-dimensional framework in which pedagogical motivation is articulated with political (linked to local characteristics) and institutional (linked to the macro-environment) motivations. They then study the respective importance the three kinds of motivation in the adoption decisions and the implementation process of DGBL. To this end, they conducted a retrospective analysis of four embedded case studies in European business schools. Findings - The authors find that institutional motivation plays a major role in adoption decisions while political motivations can contribute to the decision but are not necessarily present. Isomorphic pressure is essentially mimetic for early adopters and combined with coercive elements for late adopters. Practical implications - During the implementation phase customization is mainly driven by political objectives while institutionalized ideas about the best way to implement the game are not typically influential. Originality/value - The study shows that pedagogical benefits are a prerequisite rather than the core motivation for adoption or implementation. Second, the study is a call for both academics and practitioners not to over-rationalize or under-rationalize DGBL and, more broadly, pedagogical innovations and adoption decisions. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Nevertheless, the introduction of online reverse auctions (ORA) in the negotiation process has been perceived as a resource that decreases inter-organizational trust, limiting the possibilities of collaboration. Online reverse auctions enable buyers to achieve tremendous financial savings through a considerable decrease in suppliers' margins and profits. Consequently, online reverse auctions are blamed for destroying buyer-supplier trust and creating distrust among suppliers toward buyers. Indeed, there is a widespread perception among suppliers that online reverse auctions are unfair since they only take buyers' interests into consideration, increasing the suppliers' suspicion of buyer opportunism. Suppliers feel that online reverse auctions tend to undermine relationships, and they feel exploited by the process, consequently reducing their level of trust in buyers. This paper focuses on the outcomes of ORA use in the business relationships of one major French retailer and its industrial suppliers. Based on a case study built upon 70 semi-directive interviews, we propose an analysis of the impact of ORA use in business relationships. We show that it is not the technology of ORA itself which is responsible for trust deterioration but the way it is used. Our results suggest three factors that would allow inter-firm trust to be maintained when using ORA: the management of ORA, the integration of qualitative criteria and the eradication of abuses related to ORA use.", "aggregation_type": "Conference Proceeding", "subtype": "cp", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24329049100", "authid": "24329049100", "authname": "Charki M.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Mohamed H\u00e9di", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Defining the post-bureaucratic organization as a hybrid form provides insight into the intrinsic difficulties involved in the refurbishment of large complex organizations. The purpose of this paper is to examine these difficulties empirically. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the case of an Australian public sector agency, subject to \"corporatization\" - a metamorphosis from a strictly public sector outlook to one that was imputedly more commercial. It focuses on the transition from personnel management to strategic HRM in the HR function. Findings - A series of difficulties affected these changes: difficulties in inventing a new identity; differences in perception of that identity; organizational philosophy towards strategic HRM; unsuitability of extent networks; and identity conflicts. Two factors emerge as the core explanation for the difficulties encountered: the \"stickiness of identity\" and the difficulties associated with network development. Originality/value - The paper outlines the difficulties experienced in the putative \"refurbishment\" of a large public sector agency as it made its way to \"corporatization\". \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.?", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004414985", "authid": "7004414985", "authname": "Teo S.", "surname": "Teo", "given-name": "Stephen", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101683003", "authid": "7101683003", "authname": "Clegg S.", "surname": "Clegg", "given-name": "Stewart", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Building up on three case studies in different organizations characterized by different internal contexts, this article pushes the logic one step further by arguing that communities of practice can also be unique collaboration spaces within bureaucracies. Their main property is the ambiguity of their relationship with organizational control mechanisms and structures. Communities play with the rules, they can be adaptable and as such can build resilience within the organization. But this ambiguity, being the foundation of their capacity to introduce cooperation within organizations, is also difficult to maintain. Cultivating communities of practice thus becomes a delicate task for managers who must be able to adopt complex and contradictory behaviours. Five roles that can be fulfilled by management are analysed: stimulation, facilitation, support, control and recognition. Far from the generic recommendations that can be found in the literature to date, the findings indicate that the degree of intervention from management is highly dependent on the internal organizational context.

To this end, efforts have been made to design measures of creative personality in hopes of predicting creative performance.

We address this issue by presenting a theoretical basis for creative personality that operates on an implicit level. Using conditional reasoning methodology, we describe five cognitive biases that serve as justification mechanisms for creative personality. Next, we link implicit creative personality to creative abilities through a developmental process. We then test this model and our new measure of creative personality in five different studies. Our results provide evidence in support of an implicit component of creative personality and suggest that it is a substantial predictor of creative performance.

In Study 2, we re-examined the moderated relationships and found that the relationship between procedural justice and OCB was significantly influenced by masculinity-femininity orientation and that the relationship between distributive justice and OCB was significantly moderated by power distance such that the relationships were more strongly positive when followers were more masculine and higher in power distance. Also, we extended our model to include perceived supervisor support as a mediator of the direct and moderated effects of justice perceptions on OCB. We found support for the mediation model, but did not find the moderated mediation effects we predicted.

The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and usability of using domestic-scale 3D food printer as an assistive technology to print pureed food into attractive food shapes for people with dysphagia. Materials and Methods: In total, 16 participants engaged in the unfamiliar, novel process of using a domestic-scale 3D food printer (choosing, printing, tasting), designed for printing pureed food, and discussed their impressions in focus group or individual interviews. Results and Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrated that informed experts who were novice users perceived the 3D food printing process to be fun but time consuming, and that 3D food printers might not yet be suitable for people with dysphagia or their supporters. Slow response time, lack of user feedback, scant detail on the appropriate recipes for the pureed food to create a successful print, and small font on the user panel interface were perceived as barriers to accessibility for people with disability and older people. Participants expected more interactive elements and feedback from the device, particularly in relation to resolving printer or user errors. This study will inform future usability trials and food safety research into 3D printed foods for people with disability and dysphagia. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION 3D food printers potentially have a role as an assistive technology in the preparation of texture-modified foods for people with disability and dysphagia. To increase feasibility, 3D food printers should be co-designed with people with disability and their supporters and health professionals working in the field of dysphagia and rehabilitation. Experts struggled to be able to print 3D pureed shapes owing to relatively low usability of the 3D food printer tested with problems using the interface and resolving problems in the print. 3D food printing is a fun and novel activity and may help to engage people with disability and dysphagia in making choices around the shape of the food to be printed.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801346687", "authid": "7801346687", "authname": "Hemsley B.", "surname": "Hemsley", "given-name": "Bronwyn", "initials": "B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/25421514900", "authid": "25421514900", "authname": "Dann S.", "surname": "Dann", "given-name": "Stephen", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008950"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57685612400", "authid": "57685612400", "authname": "Reddacliff C.", "surname": "Reddacliff", "given-name": "Courtney", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57212994934", "authid": "57212994934", "authname": "Smith R.", "surname": "Smith", "given-name": "Rebecca", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14121166200", "authid": "14121166200", "authname": "Given F.", "surname": "Given", "given-name": "Fiona", "initials": "F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15126782000", "authid": "15126782000", "authname": "Gay V.", "surname": "Gay", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55234419400", "authid": "55234419400", "authname": "Leong T.W.", "surname": "Leong", "given-name": "Tuck Wah", "initials": "T.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195457613", "authid": "57195457613", "authname": "Skellern K.", "surname": "Skellern", "given-name": "Katrina", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "10", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57967424800", "authid": "57967424800", "authname": "Bull C.", "surname": "Bull", "given-name": "Chriss", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "11", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55516694300", "authid": "55516694300", "authname": "Palmer S.", "surname": "Palmer", "given-name": "Stuart", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "122554109"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "12", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203104315", "authid": "57203104315", "authname": "Balandin S.", "surname": "Balandin", "given-name": "Susan", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018805"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Yet, while current research emphasizes success stories, little is known about how firms can leverage the full potential of their social media use for open innovation. In this paper, the authors address this gap by conducting a configurational analysis to develop an integrative taxonomy of social media-enabled strategies for open innovation. This analysis stems from the integration of internal and external variables such as social media communication activities, organizational innovation seekers, potential innovation providers, the stages of the open innovation process, and their relationship with different performance outcomes and barriers to social media adoption for open innovation. Through an empirical study of 337 firms based in eight countries, four clusters have been identified that are characterized as distinct strategies: \u201cmarketing semi-open innovators,\u201d \u201ccross-department semi-open innovators,\u201d \u201ccross-department full process semi-open innovators\u201d and \u201cbroad adopters open innovators.\u201d The findings reveal the trade-offs associated with different strategies for implementing social media for open innovation and provide insights of the use of these strategies. By doing so, they suggest a more nuanced approach that contrasts with the traditionally positive (or even rosy) depiction of the effects of social media on open innovation. Accordingly, managers are encouraged to contemplate their organizational competencies, capabilities, and their strategic intent when drafting social media strategies for open innovation. Selective approaches, along with greater adoption leading to greater benefits, are shown to be more rewarding than a middle way that spreads things too thin.

Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP) perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in online community-based OI. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an exploratory case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage with online user communities on the intermediary\u2019s platform. Results incorporate both the intermediary and clients\u2019 perspective, based on analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients\u2019 online community projects and other archival data. Findings: Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge boundary management mechanisms \u2013 syntactic, semantic and pragmatic \u2013 each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively, and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at the organization\u2013community boundary. The findings show that the pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms, and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge collaboration in community-based OI settings. Practical implications: The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value: Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55523208900", "authid": "55523208900", "authname": "Randhawa K.", "surname": "Randhawa", "given-name": "Krithika", "initials": "K.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35318747600", "authid": "35318747600", "authname": "Schweitzer J.", "surname": "Schweitzer", "given-name": "Jochen", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35799878200", "authid": "35799878200", "authname": "Logue D.", "surname": "Logue", "given-name": "Danielle", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60189551"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Based on multiple interviews with the employees of the global commodity firm Gamma Chemical (around 50,000 employees), the research aims at gaining an understanding of the contextual conditions required to successfully build and leverage individuals\u2019 external social client network ties for business unit ambidexterity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a single-case study at Gamma Chemical that entailed 33 semi-directive interviews, each of which lasted 1-4 h, at different organizational levels (ranging from top-level management to production workers). We had access to three regional business units. The interviews addressed the links between the individuals in the business units and external actors. The authors also collected information about the company\u2019s strategic objectives, the local competitive environment and work organization. Open-ended questions were used to allow the interviewees to freely relate anecdotes about their own network development. In particular, the authors asked the respondents to identify business contacts with whom they interacted privately and to describe the relationships. Findings: The research findings are two-fold. First, and contrary to prior studies, the authors find that individuals\u2019 social capital contributes to both exploration and exploitation at the business unit level. Second, developing and leveraging individuals\u2019 external social capital requires a specific organizational context at the business unit level that allows employees to develop and nurture their personal business relationships with clients. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by the scope of the sample (a study of one large multinational firm). Further research conducted in similar contexts may therefore be useful for comparability purposes and to generalize the results. Practical implications: Several practical recommendations describe how managers can effectively make use of their employees\u2019 social connections with clients. In particular, the results suggest that managers should seek business unit flexibility on the basis of team-based structures, an autonomous leadership style and by actively creating a degree of critical social network tie redundancy, encouraging a shared network culture. These three specific conditions allow employees\u2019 personal client networks to not only flourish but also contribute to business unit ambidexterity. Originality/value: Prior social capital studies have analyzed intra-firm and inter-firm relationships in terms of contributing to firm ambidexterity. However, these findings have often been difficult to translate into specific organizational levels. Given business units\u2019 critical role in identifying and implementing business opportunities for a firm, the authors focus on the micro-foundations of exploratory and exploitative learning by using a social capital perspective to explore the link between employees\u2019 private external social relationships with clients and business unit ambidexterity.

It thus allows for a better understanding of corporate alumni networks and their members, while also contributing to the broader identity literature by further documenting how organizational participants can incorporate elements of a past professional experience into their self-narratives.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116071"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023932"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55824163800", "authid": "55824163800", "authname": "Villes\u00e8che F.", "surname": "Villes\u00e8che", "given-name": "Florence", "initials": "F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020188"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Such a perspective is reflected in the organisational literature, for example through the work of Strangleman (1999), Brown and Humphreys (2002) or McCabe (2004), who show how nostalgia can be present in an organisational setting. These works also highlight that nostalgia is a social emotion that is shared and co-constructed; it follows that nostalgia is to be experienced not only individually, but also with others, and thus through a variety of media. This idea that nostalgia is a social emotion has notably been leveraged in marketing, and is discussed in the related literature (see, for example, Cutcher, 2008; Kessous and Roux, 2008), but there is no discussion of the media aspect. Thus, these literatures fail to inform us about how nostalgia is mediated in organisational contexts.

If these remain unanswered, the Foucauldian approach could be relegated to a self-contradictory, ultra-relativist and partial reading grid of 'reality'. In this article, we develop a Nietzschean reading of Foucault's thinking that offers answers to these criticisms, and reinstates it as an independent philosophical project grounded in epistemological assumptions that are coherent with its ontology and methodology. Finally, we suggest that, following Nietzsche, the whole Foucauldian project can be approached as a genealogy of morals. Subsequently, we call on scholars to further explore the 'third generation' of Foucauldian studies which would study management practices as morals understood as an 'art de vivre'. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032545"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Our findings first indicate that the establishment of formal ethical criteria based on the restrictive interpretation of ethics as honesty is not enough to resolve the ethical issues that surround the introduction of a technology because it ignores the ethical values shared by most actors in the sector in terms of fairness. We show the extent to which lobbying, rumor, technical problems, and public discourse can impact on the interpretations of the technology regarding ethics. Highlighting the importance of incorporating ORAs into the broader context of relationship management that integrates ethics as fairness and not only ethics as honesty serves to illustrate why the future of ORAs might not be as bright as predicted by a theoretical interpretation of the technology that is sometimes disconnected from the realities of the field. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24329049100", "authid": "24329049100", "authname": "Charki M.H.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Mohamed H\u00e9di", "initials": "M.H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60109562"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55488731600", "authid": "55488731600", "authname": "Charki N.B.", "surname": "Charki", "given-name": "Nabila Boukef", "initials": "N.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60102126"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Design/methodology/approach - In order to identify the motivations for DGBL adoption and implementation beyond pedagogical ones, the authors use organizational theories to propose a three-dimensional framework in which pedagogical motivation is articulated with political (linked to local characteristics) and institutional (linked to the macro-environment) motivations. They then study the respective importance the three kinds of motivation in the adoption decisions and the implementation process of DGBL. To this end, they conducted a retrospective analysis of four embedded case studies in European business schools. Findings - The authors find that institutional motivation plays a major role in adoption decisions while political motivations can contribute to the decision but are not necessarily present. Isomorphic pressure is essentially mimetic for early adopters and combined with coercive elements for late adopters. Practical implications - During the implementation phase customization is mainly driven by political objectives while institutionalized ideas about the best way to implement the game are not typically influential. Originality/value - The study shows that pedagogical benefits are a prerequisite rather than the core motivation for adoption or implementation. Second, the study is a call for both academics and practitioners not to over-rationalize or under-rationalize DGBL and, more broadly, pedagogical innovations and adoption decisions. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35076891800", "authid": "35076891800", "authname": "Bardon T.", "surname": "Bardon", "given-name": "Thibaut", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008924"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12751873200", "authid": "12751873200", "authname": "Josserand E.", "surname": "Josserand", "given-name": "Emmanuel", "initials": "E.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004718"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "12751873200"}

Nevertheless, the introduction of online reverse auctions (ORA) in the negotiation process has been perceived as a resource that decreases inter-organizational trust, limiting the possibilities of collaboration. Online reverse auctions enable buyers to achieve tremendous financial savings through a considerable decrease in suppliers' margins and profits. Consequently, online reverse auctions are blamed for destroying buyer-supplier trust and creating distrust among suppliers toward buyers. Indeed, there is a widespread perception among suppliers that online reverse auctions are unfair since they only take buyers' interests into consideration, increasing the suppliers' suspicion of buyer opportunism. Suppliers feel that online reverse auctions tend to undermine relationships, and they feel exploited by the process, consequently reducing their level of trust in buyers. This paper focuses on the outcomes of ORA use in the business relationships of one major French retailer and its industrial suppliers. Based on a case study built upon 70 semi-directive interviews, we propose an analysis of the impact of ORA use in business relationships. We show that it is not the technology of ORA itself which is responsible for trust deterioration but the way it is used.

Communities play with the rules, they can be adaptable and as such can build resilience within the organization. But this ambiguity, being the foundation of their capacity to introduce cooperation within organizations, is also difficult to maintain. Cultivating communities of practice thus becomes a delicate task for managers who must be able to adopt complex and contradictory behaviours. Five roles that can be fulfilled by management are analysed: stimulation, facilitation, support, control and recognition.

These symbiotic networks correspond to industrial symbiosis networks in which wastes and by-products from other industries are incorporated into additive manufacturing processes. The adoption of blockchain technology in such a context is still in a nascent stage. Using the case study method, this research demonstrates the adoption of blockchain technology in an additive symbiotic network of a real-life context. The requirements to use a blockchain network are identified, and an architecture based on smart contracts is proposed as an enabler of the additive symbiotic network under study.

We discuss three approaches to determine the appropriate response strategy: one-best-way approach, contingency approach, and paradox approach. We argue that in the face of heterogeneous environments with conflicting demands, corporations that follow a paradox approach are likely to be more successful in preserving their legitimacy than those that adopt one of the other two approaches.

This conceptual paper examines the conditions of a legitimate transfer of regulatory power from traditional democratic nation-state processes to private regulatory schemes, such as MSIs. Democratic legitimacy is typically concerned with input legitimacy (rule credibility, or the extent to which the regulations are perceived as justified) and output legitimacy (rule effectiveness, or the extent to which the rules effectively solve the issues). In this study, we identify MSI input legitimacy criteria (inclusion, procedural fairness, consensual orientation, and transparency) and those of MSI output legitimacy (rule coverage, efficacy, and enforcement), and discuss their implications for MSI democratic legitimacy. \u00a9 2012 Business Ethics Quarterly.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34977368000", "authid": "34977368000", "authname": "Mena S.", "surname": "Mena", "given-name": "S\u00e9bastien", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9277946900", "authid": "9277946900", "authname": "Palazzo G.", "surname": "Palazzo", "given-name": "Guido", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "9277946900"}

Yet this debate overlooks the influence of the broader societal context on organizational behavior. In this article, we argue that misbehaviors of organizations (the 'barrels') and their members (the 'apples') cannot be addressed properly without a clear understanding of their broader context (the 'larder'). Whereas previously, a strong societal framework dampened the practical application of the Homo economicus concept (business actors as perfectly rational and egocentric utility-maximizing agents without any moral concern), specialization, individualization and globalization led to a business world disembedded from broader societal norms. This emancipated business world promotes a literal interpretation of Homo economicus among business organizations and their members. Consequently, we argue that the first step toward 'healthier' apples and barrels is to sanitize the larder, that is, adapt the framework in which organizations and their members evolve. \u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23090942600", "authid": "23090942600", "authname": "Gonin M.", "surname": "Gonin", "given-name": "Michael", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012614"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9277946900", "authid": "9277946900", "authname": "Palazzo G.", "surname": "Palazzo", "given-name": "Guido", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701672064", "authid": "6701672064", "authname": "Hoffrage U.", "surname": "Hoffrage", "given-name": "Ulrich", "initials": "U.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "9277946900"}

In this view business firms are conceived of as economic actors, and governments and their state agencies are considered the only political actors. We suggest that, under the conditions of globalization, the strict division of labour between private business and nation-state governance does not hold any more. Many business firms have started to assume social and political responsibilities that go beyond legal requirements and fill the regulatory vacuum in global governance. Our review of the literature shows that there are a growing number of publications from various disciplines that propose a politicized concept of corporate social responsibility.

Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI), governance institutions gathering corporations, civil society and governments, are one type of regulatory mechanisms that tries to fill this gap. However, in order to do so, they have to be democratically legitimate, which induces two main challenges. First, MSIs have to ensure that their structure and processes are perceived as legitimate (input legitimacy). Second, the implementation of their regulations and their problem-solving capacity must be effective (output legitimacy). Governance on a global context is witnessing increasing shifts, such as the development of soft law mechanisms or the participation of private actors in the definition of rules. Therefore, traditional and nationally developed mechanisms for ensuring democratic (input and output) legitimacy, such as elections, cannot simply be applied to global regulatory initiatives such as MSIs. This paper studies this problem by examining the conditions of transfer of input and output legitimacies to MSIs.

The causes of this process are manifold and have been discussed intensively in the literature (for an overview, see Held et al. 1999, Scherer and Palazzo 2008): political decisions on reducing barriers to trade and opening borders for the transfer of goods, capital and people; technological developments that lead to a decline in the costs of cross-national transportation (e.g. air cargo, container shipping) and coordination (e.g. telephone, Internet); social developments (migration, individualization, erosion of traditions); and emerging transnational risks (global environmental problems, global diseases, global security and terrorism, etc.). Today, global business firms can take advantage of blurring borders and expand their possibilities of choice for economic exchange processes by shifting their value chain activities to locations that offer lower costs or higher returns. At the same time nation-state institutions are often inadequate for the regulation of transnational businesses, providing global public goods or reducing or compensating negative externalities (Beck 2000, Kaul et al. 1999, Kaul, Grunberg and Stern 2003).

The recent development of dramatically expanded global supply chains has resulted in social and environmental problems upstream that are attributable at least in part to downstream marketers and consumers. Marketers have responded mainly by using corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication to counter the critique of CSR practice, but these claims of ethical corporate behavior often lack credibility and can result in a backlash against brands. The article argues that more adequate attention to the harmful upstream effects of downstream marketing and consumption decisions requires greater attention to stakeholder marketing and marketer efforts to help create responsible consumers.

The argument is based, among other things, on the declining capacity of nation state institutions to regulate socially desirable corporate behavior as well as the growing corporate exposure to heterogeneous social, cultural and political values in societies globally. It is argued that these changes are shifting the corporate role towards a sphere of societal governance hitherto dominated by traditional political actors. This leads to a discussion of the ambivalent results of such a process for a responsible corporate role in a globalized world. While assessing the current reception these changes have received in the management literature, the contributions of the four articles in this Special Issue are framed and evaluated.

Legal businesses might share features of the Mafia, such as the propensity to exploit a governance vacuum in society, a strong organizational identity that demarcates the inside from the outside, and an extreme profit motive. Instrumental CSR practices have the power to accelerate a firm's transition to Mafia status through its own pathologies. The boundaries of such instrumentalism are explored and lessons for future CSR research derived, with specific emphasis on a firm's social and normative embeddedness, taking into account the inherent challenge of regulating corporate behaviour in the global economy. \u00a92009 Business Ethics Quarterly.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8641107200", "authid": "8641107200", "authname": "Gond J.P.", "surname": "Gond", "given-name": "Jean Pascal", "initials": "J.P."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9277946900", "authid": "9277946900", "authname": "Palazzo G.", "surname": "Palazzo", "given-name": "Guido", "initials": "G."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36912673600", "authid": "36912673600", "authname": "Basu K.", "surname": "Basu", "given-name": "Kunal", "initials": "K."}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "9277946900"}

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) discourse builds upon a conception of organizational legitimacy that does not appropriately reflect these changes. The problems arise from the a-political role of the corporation in the concepts of cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy, which are based on compliance to national law and on relatively homogeneous and stable societal expectations on the one hand and widely accepted rhetoric assuming that all members of society benefit from capitalist production on the other. We therefore propose a fundamental shift to moral legitimacy, from an output and power oriented approach to an input related and discursive concept of legitimacy. This shift creates a new basis of legitimacy and involves organizations in processes of active justification vis-\u00e0-vis society rather than simply responding to the demands of powerful groups.

The effort towards CSR engagement in the tobacco industry is not only heavily criticized by anti-tobacco NGOs. Some opponents such as the the World Health Organization have even categorically questioned the possibility of social responsibility in the tobacco industry. The paper will demonstrate that the deep distrust towards tobacco companies is linked to the lethal character of their products and the dubious behavior of their representatives in recent decades. As a result, tobacco companies are not in the CSR business in the strict sense. Key aspects of mainstream CSR theory and practice such as corporate philanthropy, stakeholder collaboration, CSR reporting and self-regulation, are demonstrated to be ineffective or even counterproductive in the tobacco industry. Building upon the terminology used in the leadership literature, the paper proposes to differentiate between transactional and transformational CSR arguing that tobacco companies can only operate on a transactional level. As a consequence, corporate responsibility in the tobacco industry is based upon a much thinner approach to CSR and has to be conceptualized with a focus on transactional integrity across the tobacco supply chain. \u00a9 Springer 2005.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9277946900", "authid": "9277946900", "authname": "Palazzo G.", "surname": "Palazzo", "given-name": "Guido", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60242129"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9277947000", "authid": "9277947000", "authname": "Richter U.", "surname": "Richter", "given-name": "Ulf", "initials": "U.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "9277946900"}

We refer to that context in terms of culture. The management literature normally understands culture in the sense of Alexis de Tocqueville's 'habits of the heart', which is the customs, habits, norms, values, and shared views of reality, expressed in a specific behavior of individuals and groups. This paper confronts established concepts of innovativeness with recent discussions on individualized and globalized societies. According to the sociologist Ulrich Beck, we are interacting more and more in a transnational and transcultural context thereby developing shared habits of the heart beyond the established (mainly geographically bound) understanding of culture. A new culture is emerging, which he introduces as cosmopolitanism.

We propose to treat the normative foundation on the one hand (value) and stakeholders and issues on the other hand (strategy) as two dimensions of CSR that are conceptually independent of each other. We suggest that the CSR engagement of a corporation can be either on value or off value, and that it can be either on strategy or off strategy. Cross-classifying two levels of each of these leads us to consider four CSR prototypes which we label - Robber Baron, Robin Hood, Book Keeper, and Statesman. Those prototypes are shown to exhibit specific characteristics on a set of features. Our framework for categorization of CSR, analysis of featural qualities of each type, and suggested pathways for migration, opens up both construct validity aspects and comparative studies into CSR. Rather than simply developing inventories of CSR activities, and seeking correlations with financial performance measures, it is possible to turn attention to a broad range of independent (i.e., CSR preconditions) as well as dependent (i.e., CSR consequences) variables, and attempt meaningful comparisons to achieve relevant benchmarks.

First, customer empowering behaviors benefit service performance and customer-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) by enhancing harmonious passion. Second, employee core self-evaluation moderates customer empowering behaviors\u2019 positive effects on harmonious passion such that the effects are greater when an employee has a high core self-evaluation. Finally, customer empowering behaviors\u2019 indirect effects on service performance and customer-oriented OCB via harmonious passion depend on core self-evaluation, and a high core self-evaluation strengthens the above-mentioned relationships.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205755900", "authid": "57205755900", "authname": "Chen X.", "surname": "Chen", "given-name": "Xingwen", "initials": "X.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116864"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194193212", "authid": "57194193212", "orcid": "0000-0002-4501-7696", "authname": "Ye Y.", "surname": "Ye", "given-name": "Yijiao", "initials": "Y.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000937"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58596263700", "authid": "58596263700", "authname": "Zhu Z.", "surname": "Zhu", "given-name": "Zheng", "initials": "Z.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122450"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/59256333300", "authid": "59256333300", "authname": "Cui Q.", "surname": "Cui", "given-name": "Qi", "initials": "Q.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60125448"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58607959900", "authid": "58607959900", "authname": "Liu J.", "surname": "Liu", "given-name": "Jun", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022414"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "58607959900"}

Using data from the biopharmaceutical industry and a matched case\u2013control research design, we find that alliances are more likely to be terminated following acquisitions compared to alliances not subject to acquisitions. This higher termination likelihood is driven by acquisitions where the acquirer's alliance management capacity is stressed, and by alliances inherited from targets. The inherited alliance effect is attenuated by the target's partner's common connections with the acquirer but amplified by the target's partner's unique connections outside the merging firms' alliance portfolios. These findings are consistent with our relational view-based theorizing on the post-acquisition challenges of retaining alliance-based assets, contributing to corporate strategy scholarship on alliances and acquisitions. Managerial Summary: In many industries, firms' portfolios of interorganizational alliances enable them to realize novel complementarities and, thereby, enhance their performance. In such sectors, managers also frequently acquire other organizations to obtain access to critical resources. However, what managers may overlook is that acquisitions can destabilize existing alliance relationships. In this study, we show that the acquiring firm's capacity to effectively manage alliance-based assets is stressed once it inherits the target firm's alliances. In general, target firm alliances become more challenging to sustain, and, in particular, those that hold a higher potential for novelty become more unstable. Consequently, when evaluating acquisitions, managers should look beyond obvious measures of a target alliance's value and assess the post-acquisition integration challenges that may threaten its stability.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195203026", "authid": "57195203026", "authname": "Tandon V.", "surname": "Tandon", "given-name": "Vivek", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122660"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191694873", "authid": "57191694873", "authname": "Asgari N.", "surname": "Asgari", "given-name": "Navid", "initials": "N.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015095"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55101608800", "authid": "55101608800", "authname": "Ranganathan R.", "surname": "Ranganathan", "given-name": "Ram", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116471"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "55101608800"}

Analyzing the communication and voting behavior of 115 firms across three subcommittees of a computing industry technology standards-setting organization over 14 years, we find that existing product-market positions influence how firms with highly overlapped technological resources differ in their interactions: when their product-markets are more competitive, they exhibit greater support for the emerging standard, as evidenced by positivity and certainty of interaction tone; but when they possess a broader array of complementary products, support is tempered. At the subcommittee level, after accounting for aggregate competitive tensions in prior interactions, heterogeneity in both firms\u2019 relational influence as well as their prior multiparty experience improve consensus. Managerial Summary: In innovation ecosystems, competing firms are often obligated to collaborate with each other in large multifirm forums to develop the technical standards that enable interoperability between their products. We show how the networks of technical and commercial relationships between firms shape such standards activities in two steps.

Specifically, we use an inductive study of earnings conference call transcripts and analyst reports to study how analysts' evaluative schemas change with technological change in the wireline telecommunications industry. We find three temporal themes.At first, analysts pressure firms to reverse strategic changes that are at odds with the existing \"income\"-focused metrics and logic that constitute the evaluative schema. Next, schema change unfolds with the ongoing technological change, as firm performance declines when measured with traditional metrics, and as managers frame strategic changes using new \"growth\"-focused metrics and logic. Finally, a distinct shift in the schema is apparent as analysts' increasing attention to growth spurs a more positive view of strategic changes that they previously opposed, a less positive view of previously supported strategies that conformed to an income logic, and the application of the growth logic even to a firm not pursuing growth-oriented strategic changes. Results from a supplementary content analysis support these results, showing a temporal shift toward \"growth\" words in analyst reports and conference calls. Our process model emphasizes the gradual shifts in analysts' evaluative schemas that ultimately support firm responses to a new technology. We highlight the importance of managerial framing as firms facing technological change pursue strategic responses that initially diverge from stakeholders' expectations, as well as the possibility that as schemas shift, actions that initially conform to analysts' expectations may be questioned.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8777448400", "authid": "8777448400", "authname": "Benner M.J.", "surname": "Benner", "given-name": "Mary J.", "initials": "M.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60123802"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55101608800", "authid": "55101608800", "authname": "Ranganathan R.", "surname": "Ranganathan", "given-name": "Ram", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116471"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "55101608800"}

Specifically, the concepts and measures of relational, structural, and positional embeddedness (per Gulati and Gargiulo, 1999), as well as interdependence, are foundational for many studies. We explore these determinants of alliance formation by replicating the baseline analyses of Ahuja, Polidoro, and Mitchell's, 2009 SMJ article. We examine the impact of empirical choices with respect to time period, underlying data generating model, and industry by isolating each effect in turn. We demonstrate that while geographic similarity and product-market similarity each robustly predict the interdependence effect, the effects of both technological similarity as well as the embeddedness predictors are sensitive to context and/or method. Managerial summary: Our examination of alliance formation in the chemical and semiconductor industries during the 1990s demonstrates how new alliances may be predicted by both the technical, geographic, and product-market fit of potential partners as well as characteristics of each partner's previous network participation. Comparing our results to an earlier study, we find that geographic and product-market similarity predict alliance formation across both industries and time frames while prior ties between partners predict alliance formation only when these industries are less mature. Other network participation indicators generate nuanced effects, which underscore the importance of quasi-replications of alliance formation across industries and time periods in building evidence-based management theories.

Thus, the influence of network position on coordination is contingent upon the type of interorganizational tie. Furthermore, when we consider these relationships jointly, knowledge centrality moderates the opposing effect of commercialization centrality, such that the commercialization centrality effect increases with decreasing levels of knowledge centrality.

We study the reactions of securities analysts, as important sources of institutional pressures for firms, to the similar product/market strategies undertaken by firms from different prior industries responding to industry convergence. Our empirical setting is the convergence between the wireline telecommunications and cable television industries in the period following the advent of voice over Internet protocol technology. Controlling for firm financial performance and capabilities, we find that analysts were consistently more positive toward the cable firms than toward the wireline telecom firms. Our findings further show that this divergence in reactions arises from differences in existing investor expectations and preferences concerning how firms create value; stocks owned by investors with a greater preference for growth receive more positive reactions than those owned by investors with a greater preference for margins. However, this divergence in reactions shrinks over time as convergence unfolds and as investors shift their shareholdings in response to misalignment between their preferences and firms' strategic changes. Reactions from analysts-reflecting inertial expectations of investors-may persist for a time despite changes to firms' strategies, thus creating challenges for some firms in responding to technological change and industry convergence while legitimating and enabling similar responses from their competitors. \u00a9 2013 Informs.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8777448400", "authid": "8777448400", "authname": "Benner M.J.", "surname": "Benner", "given-name": "Mary J.", "initials": "M.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60123802"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55101608800", "authid": "55101608800", "authname": "Ranganathan R.", "surname": "Ranganathan", "given-name": "Ram", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116471"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "55101608800"}

Using data collected from 145 ICVs operating in 72 corporate parents, this research reveals that corporations with more attractive core businesses grant greater planning autonomy to their ICVs\u2019 managers, and planning autonomy contributes to ICV performance. Additional results reveal the moderating effects within our structural model of venture manager experience and the similarity of the ICV\u2019s product to those of other businesses within the corporation. Considered collectively, this research demonstrates why corporations that \u201cneed\u201d their ICVs to be successful \u2013 because of poor prospects in their core businesses \u2013 are most likely to mismanage them. Unattractive core business prospects can be viewed as justifying corporate managers\u2019 involvement in the direct management of their firms\u2019 ICVs. However, venture planning autonomy is needed to avoid placing undue expectations on ICVs as the \u201csaviors\u201d of corporate performance. By extension, this need for autonomy is also anticipated to apply to other entrepreneurial contexts where experimentation and learning are significant concerns (e.g., business incubators, corporate venture capital investments, new venture divisions). Plain English Summary: This research demonstrates how and why corporations that have attractive core business operations are most likely to be good corporate parents to their internal corporate ventures (ICVs), and vice versa. In a sense, when it comes to internal corporate venturing, \u201cthe rich corporations get richer, and the poor corporations get poorer.\u201d Parent corporations with more attractive core business prospects were found to grant greater planning autonomy to the managers of their ICVs, and autonomy is needed to give ICV managers the discretion and flexibility they need when navigating their ventures though unchartered business territory. Overall, this research demonstrates the importance of corporate managers (1) granting ICV managers autonomy in planning their venture operations, (2) being willing to consider engaging in internal corporate venturing even though their firms\u2019 existing, core business operations may be attractive (i.e., before these ICVs \u201cneed\u201d to be successful), and (3) not putting too much pressure on ICVs to \u201cperform,\u201d and avoiding meddling in the management of those ventures, when prospects in the corporation\u2019s core business are unattractive. We argue that autonomy is likely efficacious in most entrepreneurial contexts where experimentation and learning are significant concerns (e.g., business incubators, corporate venture capital investments, new venture divisions).", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60010783"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24481294100", "authid": "24481294100", "authname": "Garrett R.P.", "surname": "Garrett", "given-name": "Robert P.", "initials": "R.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60028599"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14053594000", "authid": "14053594000", "authname": "Bouncken R.B.", "surname": "Bouncken", "given-name": "Ricarda B.", "initials": "R.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023208"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56286807200", "authid": "56286807200", "authname": "Ratzmann M.", "surname": "Ratzmann", "given-name": "Martin", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023208"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58606593500", "authid": "58606593500", "authname": "Muhammad M.", "surname": "Muhammad", "given-name": "Malcolm", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "130217463"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "24481294100"}

Using the lens of complexity, we conduct an ethnographic study of the competing logics at work in the NPD processes of a corporate makerspace launched by a large firm in the consumer appliances industry. The makerspace was founded with a hybrid logic, intended to combine the community logic of makers with the corporate logic of the parent organization.

We identify how managing multiple logics led to structural and identity changes, and we explain how two mechanisms\u2014structural bridging and stakeholder identity linking\u2014enabled the makerspace to innovate with a hybrid logic and overcome the constraints of a dominant logic on the NPD process.

Although this metatheoretical perspective overcomes some problems with previous views and helps to identify the essence of a construct, the level of abstraction required by this approach leaves unanswered questions related to how social entrepreneurs leverage opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to create a framework to describe social entrepreneurial opportunities in a way that facilitates action and decision-making by social entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: Through adapting Davidsson's (2015) deconstruction of the opportunity construct and using it to inform the pragmatist view of entrepreneurs as theory-testing scientists, this paper develops a framework for understanding social entrepreneurial opportunities. The paper explores the idea that social opportunities are composed of external enablers, a new social venture idea, and social opportunity confidence, and integrates the existing literature on social opportunities into this framework. Findings: Using the framework developed, the authors advance a template of questions, hypotheses and quasi-experimental means that social entrepreneurs can use to determine how to move forward in social opportunity actualization. The authors also expand three categories of research questions that scholars may explore to extend the practical and theoretical understanding of social opportunities. Originality/value: This work is among the first to adopt the pragmatist lens to elucidate social opportunities in a practical way. It takes an important first step in offering a means for social entrepreneurs to investigate when or where the requisite components of a social entrepreneurial opportunity may exist.

Drawing on family development theory, we offer midrange reasoning about the impact of enterprising family dynamics\u2014such as the birth of a child or children leaving home\u2014on the motivation for corporate venturing and its changes over time. Moreover, our model also accounts for the contingent effect of ownership and business developmental dimensions. Finally, we predict that motivation for corporate venturing can, in turn, spur the development of the enterprising family. Managerial summary: Overcoming the idea that family firms are either very or minimally entrepreneurial, we focus on the enterprising family and consider its development to explain the motivation toward corporate venturing. We look at the evolution of the roles and norms of family members over time and predict that motivation for venturing increases with family growth until the moment in which a succession takes place and the younger generation receives the baton. We also consider how changes in the ownership structure and business growth influence the relationship between family development and motivation for venturing. The latter, in turn, can trigger the development of the enterprising family itself, with its structure and norms. Our work, in sum, depicts the enterprising family as a springboard for repeated acts of entrepreneurship across generations.

Findings \u2013 Results indicate that respondents perceive the signal provided by compilation reports, review reports and audit reports as increasing in reliability and are more likely to invest in a venture providing reports with that increasing reliability.

Consequently, potential investors may require less additional information from entrepreneurs with audited financial statements when conducting due diligence investigations.

These ventures, however, often fail, and previous research has revealed surprisingly little about the antecedents to performance for this strategically important phenomenon. Using resource dependence theory and the resource-based view, a model is developed wherein the positive relationship between top management support and the internal corporate venture's (ICV) initial strategic asset endowment is moderated by the amount of the venture's operations autonomy. We then argue how top management support, the venture's initial strategic asset endowment, and parent-venture product similarity are related to ICV performance. Primary data were collected from 72 firms which furnished data on 145 ICVs. The results suggest that increases in the level of support provided by top management leads to higher levels of initial strategic assets endowed in the corporate venture. This relationship, however, is weakened the more corporate parents give their ICVs operations autonomy. Further, top management's support of the corporate venture, as well as the level of initial strategic assets endowed to the venture, increases the subsequent performance of the ICV. The performance benefit of these initial strategic assets, however, is lower the more there is an overlap between the parent's and the venture's products. \u00a9 2013 Product Development & Management Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24481294100", "authid": "24481294100", "authname": "Garrett R.P.", "surname": "Garrett", "given-name": "Robert P.", "initials": "R.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602642757", "authid": "6602642757", "authname": "Neubaum D.O.", "surname": "Neubaum", "given-name": "Donald O.", "initials": "D.O.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122767"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "24481294100"}

Governance structure is a well-understood knowledge protection strategy designed to reduce knowledge leakage concerns and thereby encourage desired knowledge transfers in two-party R&D alliances. Whether governance structure can be an important balancing mechanism for R&D alliances with multiple partner firms, or multilateral R&D alliances, however, requires further study. Because increasing the number of alliance partners introduces additional complexities to managing an alliance, the appropriate governance mechanism for a multilateral R&D alliance is likely to differ from that for a bilateral alliance. Drawing insights from social exchange theory, we explore governance decisions in multilateral R&D alliances. First, we examine the potential for variance between multilateral and bilateral R&D alliances in governance decisions as a means of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection. Results based on our analysis of 2,423 R&D alliances, 1,690 bilateral and 733 multilateral, are consistent with predictions drawn from social exchange theory. We next focus on three-partner R&D alliances, or trilateral R&D alliances, and compare governance mechanisms between two types of trilateral R&D alliances: chain and net. We find that equity governance structures are more likely to be used in net-based than in chain-based trilateral R&D alliances; we also find that alliance scope moderates the relationship between the type of alliance and governance structure. Finally, we find that multilateral R&D alliances with predicted (aligned) governance structures perform better, in terms of alliance longevity, than those with misaligned structures. \u00a92012 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23393282100", "authid": "23393282100", "authname": "Li D.", "surname": "Li", "given-name": "Dan", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003796845", "authid": "7003796845", "authname": "Eden L.", "surname": "Eden", "given-name": "Lorraine", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138449"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8092411400", "authid": "8092411400", "authname": "Hitt M.A.", "surname": "Hitt", "given-name": "Michael A.", "initials": "M.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138449"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56111740200", "authid": "56111740200", "authname": "Ireland R.D.", "surname": "Ireland", "given-name": "R.

Moderated regression analysis based on data collected from 111 manufacturing firms supports the hypotheses. Top management risk taking and market responsiveness positively predict the use of a pioneering strategy. Strategic learning self efficacy makes market pioneering more palatable to risk-averse top managers who might not otherwise engage in pioneering.

The exhibition of strategic adaptability - the ability of a firm to alter its alignment with the environment through reactive and proactive behaviors (Evans, 1991) - is a function of the goodness-of-fit that exists between the capabilities of a firm and the demands imposed by its relevant industry context (Burgelman & Grove, 1996). When firm capabilities are well aligned with industry success factors, those capabilities constitute strategic assets for the firm, or resources that lead to the achievement of competitive success in that context (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993). The possession of strategic assets thus contributes to a state of adaptation, defined by Chakravarthy (1982) as a state in which an organization exhibits the capacity to survive the conditions of its changing environment.

Yet, in recent years, crowdfunding (CF) has become a viable new source of funding for entrepreneurs. Using a longitudinal assessment of VC and CF at the national, regional, and sector levels in the USA, we demonstrate how the emergence of CF has unlocked new growth opportunities for main street entrepreneurs, particularly those located in underserviced funding regions. Likewise, we expose how CF augments national and regional funding patterns by re-allocating funding to industries that VCs typically do not fund. Lastly, we discuss the practical and theoretical implications of what appears to be a shifting venture funding regime, and shed light on CF\u2019s potential role in enhancing the resurgence of main street entrepreneurship across the USA.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57171525300", "authid": "57171525300", "authname": "Stevenson R.M.", "surname": "Stevenson", "given-name": "Regan M.", "initials": "R.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56971405500", "authid": "56971405500", "authname": "Eutsler J.", "surname": "Eutsler", "given-name": "Jared", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60024438"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602956196"}

Managerial decisions regarding innovative activity are complex and can be affected by numerous factors. In this study, we draw upon the tenets of stakeholder theory to examine how stakeholder salience (consisting of stockholders, employees, and customers) is integral to the decisions made by senior level managers related to social proactiveness within a corporate innovation strategy. In doing so, we introduce a social proactiveness scale that examines a manager\u2019s priorities toward internal and external social issues. Examining 200 senior-level managers, we find that companies which place salience on employees are more proactive on both internal and external social issues, while those placing salience on stockholders are more proactive on internal social issues but not external social issues. Surprisingly, placing salience on customers is associated with neither internal nor external social issues. Finally, the data suggests that proactiveness related to internal social issues leads to greater internal innovation with external innovation mediating the relationship, whereas proactiveness on external social issues is not related to innovation.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8281897800", "authid": "8281897800", "authname": "Goldsby M.G.", "surname": "Goldsby", "given-name": "Michael G.", "initials": "M.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60028244"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021121"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36949349300", "authid": "36949349300", "authname": "Bishop J.W.", "surname": "Bishop", "given-name": "James W.", "initials": "J.W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002162"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9435091600", "authid": "9435091600", "authname": "Kreiser P.M.", "surname": "Kreiser", "given-name": "Patrick M.", "initials": "P.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004354"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003407422", "authid": "7003407422", "authname": "Hornsby J.S.", "surname": "Hornsby", "given-name": "Jeffrey S.", "initials": "J.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007056"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602956196"}

We, therefore, theorize about a unique paradox for entrepreneurs trying to establish legitimacy for their new ventures within and beyond an entrepreneurial ecosystem; that is, when pursuing opportunities with high levels of technological or market newness, entrepreneurs confront a significant challenge in legitimizing their venture within an entrepreneurial ecosystem, while those entrepreneurs pursuing ventures using existing technologies or pursuing existing markets have a much easier path to garnering legitimacy within that ecosystem. However, the diffusion of that legitimacy beyond the ecosystem will be wider and more far-reaching for those pursuing the newer elements compared to those using existing technologies or pursuing existing markets, thus, creating a paradox of venture legitimation. Prior research outlines approaches for new venture legitimacy but it is unclear when these approaches should be applied within and beyond an entrepreneurial ecosystem. To address this paradox, we integrate ideas from the entrepreneurship and innovation literature with insights from the legitimacy literature to describe how different types of venture newness employ different legitimation strategies which results in different levels of legitimacy diffusion beyond an ecosystem.

Although social entrepreneurship researchers have begun to study the identification and exploitation of opportunities to create social value, this research has taken place primarily within the context of startup organizations. In contrast, corporate entrepreneurship research has emphasized value creation within existing firms, but focused primarily on the identification and exploitation of opportunities to create financial value. Combining the two, we examine the creation of social value within the firm by proposing the social corporate entrepreneurship scale (SCES), a new instrument that measures organizational antecedents for social corporate entrepreneurship and offers managers an opportunity to analyze whether the perceived environment is supportive of corporate entrepreneurial behaviors intended to create social as well as financial value.

For the benefit of the readers, please find below the executive summary for this article. The publisher would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused. Executive Summary New technology ventures must be able to marshal resources and support from a diverse array of external actors for their survival and sustainability. For members of an external audience to provide a new venture with resources and support, they need to perceive the venture as legitimate (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Lounsbury & Glynn, 2011; van Werven, Bouwmeester, & Cornelissen, 2015; Zimmerman & Zeitz, 2002). It is therefore not surprising that new venture legitimacy has been the focus of a wealth of research over the past two decades. However, despite the breadth of research in this area, some significant gaps remain in our understanding of new venture legitimacy judgments; one of which stems from our limited understanding of how new venture legitimacy judgments differ across various new venture audiences (\u00dcberbacher, 2014). Since legitimacy assessments represent social judgments that reside in the eye of the beholder (Ashforth & Gibbs, 1990; Bitektine, 2011; Webb, Tihanyi, Ireland, & Sirmon, 2009), such assessments are audience dependent (Suchman, 1995).We therefore examine how technology entrepreneurs manage new venture legitimacy judgments across diverse audiences, so as to appear legitimate to the different audience groups that provide much needed financial resources for venture survival and growth. To do so, we first identify and describe the different mechanisms by which entrepreneurs can establish new venture legitimacy across diverse audiences. We reviewed 70 articles on new venture legitimation published between 1986 and 2015 and identified a variety of things that an entrepreneur might do to enhance and manage the legitimacy of a new venture. We carefully ordered, linked and grouped all these mechanisms into three broad categories: (1) identity mechanisms that account for how a venture is portrayed in its identity claims and espoused symbols and images; (2) associative mechanisms that reflect which organizations and individuals a new venture is tied with, and (3) organizational mechanisms that account for the attributes of organizational leaders and espoused organizational achievements and success measures. Recently scholars have highlighted that different new venture supporters likely operate with contrasting institutional logics, and thus an institutional logics perspective provides a theoretically meaningful basis to distinguish between different categories of new venture audiences (Pahnke, Katila & Eisenhardt, 2015). We account for the institutional logics that characterize different new venture audience groups and use this as a basis for uncovering how and why the legitimacy criteria for a new technology venture may vary depending on the audience. Specifically, we consider how identity, associative and organizational new venture legitimation mechanisms need to vary for different audiences providing new venture financing including: (1) crowdfunding backers operating with a community logic, (2) government agents operating with a state logic, (3) angel investors operating with a market logic, (4) VCs operating with a professional logic, and (5) CVCs operating with a corporate logic. Finally, we draw from the research on framing to describe how technology entrepreneurs may use emphasis framing to deal with the aforementioned challenge of establishing new venture legitimacy with different audiences and thereby improve their chances of accessing critical financial resources for venture survival and growth. Emphasis frames enable entrepreneurs to quickly and strategically adjust salient elements of their presentations, pitches, videos, documents, or meeting discussions to emphasize specific legitimacy mechanisms \u2013 including identity, associative and organizational ones \u2013 that align with the institutional logic of the focal audience. The conceptual frameworks developed in this study provide a meaningful theoretical base for intensifying and extending the research examining the strategic establishment and management of new venture legitimacy for entrepreneurial resource acquisition.

The field of entrepreneurship has evolved in a rather disjointed or seemingly random manner, and entrepreneurship has developed as a business discipline by borrowing, building upon, and adapting theoretical and conceptual work from such fields as sociology, psychology, anthropology, marketing, management, finance, organizational behavior, and engineering. And yet, it would appear that the volume of work attempting to describe, explain, and predict aspects of entrepreneurship has grown to a point where we can begin to develop a more complete and integrated picture.

An ethical concern has arisen in the use and abuse of these new systems. We examine the underlying ethical issues that entrepreneurs are confronting in this time of surging e-commerce. Using 32 vignettes, one for each cross-section of our research construct framework, followed by two Likert scales for respondents to indicate their agreement with the action described from both the perspective of ethicality and professional acceptability, we received responses for 1,252 vignettes, which generated a dataset of 2,504 data points. The results of our pilot study suggest that the ethical considerations for business professionals conducting business online are more nuanced and complex than conventional wisdom on the subject might suggest. While 60 research subjects are small, the use of paired vignettes in our survey allowed us to measure at least 1,000 paired responses for each research construct. The results have the potential of revealing how young professionals have been conditioned by the prevalence of web-based interactions and the anonymity they afford participants, as well as the degree to which they rationalize the misrepresentation of information by business professionals for the purpose of manipulating consumers purchasing decisions in order to drive sales. If consumers trust in reputation management systems erodes, the result could be a collapse of the entire system as a meaningful source of information.

These landmark studies are descriptive of where opportunities come from and what entrepreneurs typically do in pursuing them. While useful in better understanding the opportunity phenomenon, a new line of prescriptive research is being developed that offers guidelines in how entrepreneurs should pursue opportunity. The premise of prescriptive research is that while we may gain knowledge on what entrepreneurs typically do, might there be better ways they could pursue opportunity if they were taught a different way? The two leading prescriptive models are systematic search and effectuation. Systematic search is not a theory of how entrepreneurs find and exploit business ideas, rather it is an empirically tested system that produces superior results when compared to unconstrained search (Fiet, 2002, 2007; Fiet et al., 2007; Fiet, Piskounov and Patel, 2005).

While many causal reasons can be offered, our research on corporate entrepreneurship and innovation demonstrates there are four key implementation issues that most corporations are not recognizing or responding to effectively. Effective recognition of and response to these four implementation issues may represent the difference between those companies that create a successful corporate innovation strategy and those that do not. The four issues are: (1) understanding what type of innovation is being sought, (2) coordinating managerial roles, (3) effectively using operating controls, and (4) properly training and preparing individuals.

The key to both individual and organizational prosperity in a dynamic, threatening and complex world is the ability to think and act in more entrepreneurial ways. A new wave of economic development is sweeping the world, with entrepreneurship and innovation as the primary catalysts. Within the world of education, it can be argued that the at-risk student is the one not prepared for this entrepreneurial age. While every student has the potential, most lack the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and capabilities that define entrepreneurial competence. Over these past four decades, entrepreneurship has grown within universities faster than virtually any other area of intellectual pursuit. And it appears that the pace is accelerating with more universities seeking to develop programs and centers focused on entrepreneurship. Yet, understanding how to build entrepreneurship programs that empower and transform has remained challenging for some institutions. In this chapter, we investigate the development of entrepreneurship programs in universities. More specifically we contend that they should be created for empowerment and transformation across the campus. We describe some of the most common structural forms, outline the different degree programs, and emphasize the empowering and transforming effects of these programs for all the stakeholders of a university.

But how is that environment identified or measured? As research on corporate entrepreneurial activity has evolved, numerous researchers have acknowledged the importance of internal organizational dimensions to promoting and supporting an environment for innovation. This research has identified five specific dimensions that are important determinants of an environment conducive to entrepreneurial behavior: (1) top management support, (2) work discretion/autonomy, (3) rewards/reinforcement, (4) time availability, and (5) organizational boundaries. If an organization is serious about developing an internal environment conducive to entrepreneurial activity, then it must seek to measure the specific dimensions associated with an innovative environment. In this article we introduce an instrument, the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI), as a diagnostic tool used for assessing managers' perceptions of the five major dimensions critical to creating an entrepreneurial/innovative environment. This instrument provides an indication of a firm's likelihood of being able to successfully implement an innovative strategy, and highlights areas of the internal work environment that should be the focus of ongoing development efforts. \u00a9 2013 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003407422", "authid": "7003407422", "authname": "Hornsby J.S.", "surname": "Hornsby", "given-name": "Jeffrey S.", "initials": "J.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60007056"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602956196"}

Fortunately, knowledge accumulation on the topic has been occurring at a rapid rate and many of the elements essential to constructing a theoretically grounded understanding of CE can be readily identified from the extant literature. Corporate entrepreneurship may possess the critical components needed for the future productivity of global organizations. However, it is a far reaching concept that encompasses differing aspects and as research continues to increase in this field a stronger perspective of what constitutes corporate entrepreneurship needs to be examined. Our purpose in this article is to outline the various domains that currently exist in the research arena of corporate entrepreneurship. Exploring these domains and gaining a sharper focus on the corporate entrepreneurship process may be a most important step for scholars interested in moving the field forward. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006423146", "authid": "7006423146", "authname": "Audretsch D.B.", "surname": "Audretsch", "given-name": "David B.", "initials": "D.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602956196"}

However, there are theoretical reasons suggesting that three dimensions of EO (innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking) may possess differential relationships with performance in smaller firms. This study utilizes a sample consisting of 1,668 small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in nine countries across 13 different industries to provide a finer-grained analysis of the EO-performance relationship. Specifically, we theorize and test a non-monotonic influence of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking on SME performance. Innovativeness and proactiveness displayed predominantly positive U-shaped relationships with SME performance. Risk-taking, however, displayed a predominantly negative U-shaped relationship with SME performance. Further, individualism was found to positively moderate the relationships between innovativeness-performance and proactiveness-performance. Taken together, these results suggest that differential relationships exist between three dimensions of EO and SME performance, with important theoretical implications for future EO research. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9435091600", "authid": "9435091600", "authname": "Kreiser P.M.", "surname": "Kreiser", "given-name": "Patrick M.", "initials": "P.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011132"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23095120600", "authid": "23095120600", "authname": "Marino L.D.", "surname": "Marino", "given-name": "Louis D.", "initials": "L.D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60119544"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102540793", "authid": "7102540793", "authname": "Weaver K.M.", "surname": "Weaver", "given-name": "K.

The one true enduring force is entrepreneurship and the innovation it creates. However, that same force surges in the growing field of entrepreneurship education. In the midst of this huge expansion of entrepreneurship education we have witnessed significant accomplishments in entrepreneurship theory, process, and practice.

Likewise, growing evidence suggests that effective operations control is a common quality of successful firms. On the surface the two phenomena - corporate entrepreneurship and operations control - may seem to be inherently at odds. That is, corporate entrepreneurship is aimed at taking the firm in new directions, while operations control is aimed at channeling and often restricting actions. As such, it would be useful to know how operations control variables act in concert with the determinants of corporate entrepreneurial activity to promote the innovation outcomes that facilitate long-term organizational success. In this study of 177 firms operating in a wide variety of industries, we investigate the effect on innovation performance of several commonly-acknowledged antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship, as measured by the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (e.g., Hornsby et al., 2008, 2002); namely, management support, work discretion/autonomy, rewards/reinforcements, time availability, and organizational boundaries. More importantly, we examine the moderating effects of operations control variables - specifically risk control and process control formality - on the relationships between the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance. Results indicate that only two of the five antecedents to corporate entrepreneurship have main effects on innovation performance with moderate significance. However, each of the five antecedents significantly interacts with one or both of the operations control variables and, thereby, influences innovation performance. The implications of these results in relation to operations management and corporate entrepreneurship theory and practice are discussed. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603934583", "authid": "6603934583", "authname": "Goodale J.C.", "surname": "Goodale", "given-name": "John C.", "initials": "J.C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029472"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003407422", "authid": "7003407422", "authname": "Hornsby J.S.", "surname": "Hornsby", "given-name": "Jeffrey S.", "initials": "J.S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138813"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602956196"}

We propose that these ventures are driven by a \" quest for legitimacy\" and that life sciences entrepreneurs therefore must be aware of the strategic issues which impact legitimacy in the eyes of external stakeholders (e.g., investors). \u00a9 2009 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602956196", "authid": "6602956196", "authname": "Kuratko D.F.", "surname": "Kuratko", "given-name": "Donald F.", "initials": "D.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26538557900", "authid": "26538557900", "authname": "Brown T.J.", "surname": "Brown", "given-name": "Travis J.", "initials": "T.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60010875"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "6602956196"}

In this study, corporate entrepreneurship is used in a broad sense to include the development and implementation of new ideas into the organization. Using this definition, this study describes an instrument used to empirically identify the internal conditions that influence middle manager's participation in corporate entrepreneurship activities. During the last decade, the role of the middle manager in corporate entrepreneurial activity has been recognized in the literature. The empirical research on the internal organizational factors that may foster middle manager activity has been limited, both in volume and scope. However, the literature does converge on at least five possible factors. The appropriate use of rewards: The literature stresses that an effective reward system that spurs entrepreneurial activity must consider goals, feedback, emphasis on individual responsibility, and results-based incentives. This factor, therefore, highlights middle managers' role in this regard. Gaining top management support: The willingness of senior management to facilitate and promote entrepreneurial activity in the organization, including championing innovative ideas as well as providing necessary resources, expertise or protection. This factor captures middle managers' role in this area. Resource availability: Middle managers must perceive the availability of resources for innovative activities to encourage experimentation and risk taking. Supportive organizational structure: The structure must foster the administrative mechanisms by which ideas are evaluated, chosen, and implemented. Structural boundaries tend to be a major stumbling block for middle management in corporate entrepreneurial activity. Risk taking and tolerance for failure: Middle managers must perceive an environment that encourages calculated risk taking while maintaining reasonable tolerance for failure. The literature on the internal factors was utilized to develop an assessment instrument called the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI). The instrument contained 84 Likert-style questions that were believed to assess a firm's internal entrepreneurial environment. Understanding middle manager perceptions about the internal corporate environment is crucial to initiating and nurturing any entrepreneurial process. A scale such as the CEAI, therefore, could be very useful for companies that wish to embark on a strategic transformation through corporate entrepreneurship. The measurement properties of the CEAI, including a factor analysis and reliability assessment, were determined. Results confirmed that five distinct internal organizational factors, similar to those suggested in the literature, do exist. Based on how the items loaded on each factor, the factors were entitled management support, work discretion, organizational boundaries, rewards/reinforcement, and time availability. The reliability of each of these factors also met acceptable measurement standards. From a managerial perspective, the results indicate that CEAI can be a useful tool in diagnosing a firm's environment for corporate entrepreneurship, identifying areas where middle managers can make a significant difference, and develop strategies that can positively spur and sustain corporate entrepreneurship efforts. The results of such diagnosis can be useful in designing effective training programs for middle managers. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: A novel approach was employed in identifying the most influential research articles that have made use of Simon's two great management works, Administrative Behavior and Organizations (with James March). The list allowed the close analysis of the nature of the influence wielded by Herbert Simon on management scholarship. The process of analysis was guided by a targeted search. Google Scholar allowed the compilation of a list of top-cited research articles that made use of the two books. The 25 most-cited articles associated with each were then categorized by their subject matter and examined for the impact of Simon's research. Findings: As measured by citations, Herbert Simon's influence on management scholarship has been immense. Administrative Behavior and Organizations have incurred huge numbers of citations, more than 7,000 each. Moreover, not one of the 50 papers populating the two lists has generated fewer than 1,000 citations. Both works contributed heavily to research on theories of the firm, organizational learning and knowledge, and on organizational coordination and decision-making, among other topics. Originality/value: An emerging research tool, Google Scholar, was engaged, allowing an empirically based analysis of Herbert Simon's contribution to management scholarship. The results mark, with unusual clarity, the direction and nature of Simon's enormous influence. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8567421900", "authid": "8567421900", "authname": "Kerr G.", "surname": "Kerr", "given-name": "Gerry", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60190568"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "8567421900"}

A particular problem with widely used technical standards such as LTE and Wi-Fi is the lack of information regarding which patents are \u201cessential\u201d to implement the standard. This information is crucial because it simplifies determining infringement and implies specific \u201cFRAND\u201d licensing rules. While many standards-developing organizations stipulate that such patents are explicitly declared, little is known about which are actually essential. The absence of publicly available information on essentiality incurs significant social costs due to the resulting friction in the licensing market. With the growing use and importance of standards to mobility and energy markets, and to the Internet of Things, these costs are likely to rise. Responding to calls from industry, courts and policymakers, commercial and academic studies have attempted to assess essentiality, but they all have limitations. This paper reports on the technical feasibility of a system of expert assessments for patent essentiality. Based on a factorial design, we conducted a field experiment with 20 patent examiners performing over 100 assessments. Comparing the outcomes to a high-quality reference point shows that sufficiently accurate expert assessments, at a price level that allows large scale testing, are technically feasible, and we identify routes to further improvement.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56229128400", "authid": "56229128400", "authname": "Bekkers R.", "surname": "Bekkers", "given-name": "Rudi", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032882"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37076010000", "authid": "37076010000", "authname": "Tur E.M.", "surname": "Tur", "given-name": "Elena M.", "initials": "E.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60032882"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019722"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57814199400", "authid": "57814199400", "authname": "van der Vorst T.", "surname": "van der Vorst", "given-name": "Tommy", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "128392289"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57814199500", "authid": "57814199500", "authname": "Driesse M.", "surname": "Driesse", "given-name": "Menno", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "128392289"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55027568400", "authid": "55027568400", "authname": "Contreras J.L.", "surname": "Contreras", "given-name": "Jorge L.", "initials": "J.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025488"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

One determinant of MFT efficiency neglected until now is licensing level\u2014that is, the level in the value chain where patents are licensed. Patents may be licensed upstream, to firms that put the patented knowledge into practice. I refer to this as integrated licensing. Alternatively, patents may be licensed further downstream in the value chain, in particular to makers of final devices. I call this bifurcated licensing since it separates intellectual property rights from the technical knowledge they cover. I study the licensing level of essential patents on communication standards such as LTE and Wi-Fi in relation to the Internet of Things (IoT). The choice of licensing level in this context is currently a hotly debated topic. To show how bifurcated licensing affects MFT efficiency, I present empirical evidence from a qualitative study comprising interviews with 30 individuals from 22 diverse firms, focusing on startups. IoT device makers clearly find the uncertainty regarding infringement, patent validity, and the licensing process hinders efficient licensing, which is compounded by the large number of IoT device makers and, for SMEs and startups, by resource constraints. As a theory contribution, I show that a patent's licensing level need not correspond with the implementation level of the patented knowledge\u2014in other words, licensing may be bifurcated rather than integrated. I develop a model of how licensing level affects MFT efficiency. Implications for practice are that device-level licensing of standard-essential patents (SEPs), if broadly implemented, would have a negative effect on innovation and entrepreneurship in the IoT.

We address this question by analyzing the various selection effects through which patents become subject to validity decisions. Empirically, we focus on Germany, where revocation proceedings are separate from infringement suits and where, in court decisions during the period of 2010\u20132012, 45% of patents were determined to be fully invalid and 33% to be partially invalid. Based on data gleaned through expert interviews, a survey among lawyers, and an econometric analysis of court judgments, we find the likelihood of (hypothetical) invalidation of a randomly picked patent to be in the same range as that for actually adjudicated patents. As the main cause of patent invalidity we identify incomplete searches for prior art during examination. Our arguments carry over to other legislations.

Traditional explanations for patent portfolio races rest on an assumption of fragmented patent ownership where multiple unknown firms employ defensive strategies to forestall holdup.

To explore patent portfolio races under conditions of concentrated ownership we turn to the newspaper printing machine industry, an industry characterized by a few dominant firms. Using multiple sources \u2013 patent analysis, archival data, and interviews \u2013 we identify antecedents to a phenomenon we label offensive patent portfolio races. Contrary to received wisdom, we find that patent portfolio races can be offensive, aimed at gaining rather than avoiding loss of competitive advantage. Offensive patent portfolio races hinge on the breakdown of cooperation \u2013 triggered by changes in the perceived benefits, effectiveness, and/or costs of patents, partly mediated by the adoption of a gain frame towards increased patenting, and regulated by the potential losses from further increases.

They do so by choosing, at equal cost, the success probability of their R&D approach, where a lower probability accompanies higher value in case of success - that is, a more radical innovation. In the second stage, successful entrants bid to be acquired by the incumbent. We assume that entrants cannot survive on their own, so being acquired amounts to a prize in a contest. We identify an equilibrium in which the incumbent performs the least radical project. Entrants pick pairwise different projects; the bigger the number of entrants, the more radical the most radical project.

Although extant literature explains why individuals in IT would act unethically in many situations, we know surprisingly little about what causes them to do so during the creative act of programming. To address this issue, we look at the reuse of Internet-accessible code: software source code legally available for gratis download from the Internet. Specifically, we scrutinize the reasons why individuals would unethically reuse such code by not checking or purposefully violating its accompanying license obligations, thus risking harm for their employer. By integrating teleological and deontological ethical judgments into a theory of planned behavior model - using elements of expected utility, deterrence, and ethical work climate theory - we construct an original theoretical framework to capture individuals' decision-making process leading to the unethical reuse of Internet-accessible code. We test this framework with a unique survey of 869 professional software developers. Our findings advance the theoretical and practical understanding of ethical behavior in information systems. We show that programmers use consequentialist ethical judgments when carrying out creative tasks and that ethical work climates influence programmers indirectly through their peers' judgment of what is appropriate behavior. For practice, where code reuse promises substantial efficiency and quality gains, our results highlight that firms can prevent unethical code reuse by informing developers of its negative consequences, building a work climate that fosters compliance with laws and professional codes, and making sure that excessive time pressure is avoided.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021403000", "authid": "15021403000", "authname": "Sojer M.", "surname": "Sojer", "given-name": "Manuel", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36439193000", "authid": "36439193000", "authname": "Alexy O.", "surname": "Alexy", "given-name": "Oliver", "initials": "O.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56769760800", "authid": "56769760800", "authname": "Kleinknecht S.", "surname": "Kleinknecht", "given-name": "Sven", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012821"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

Extant literature has pointed out the potential benefits of such behavior, but falls short of explaining what triggers firms to practice it in the first place and to maintain or extend it. Since the waiving of IPRs runs counter to common views on strategy and competition and to engrained practices, this is a non-trivial question. To address it, we conduct an empirical study in a segment of the computer component industry which traditionally has taken a rather proprietary stance. With the advent of the open source operating system Linux, firms increasingly waived their IPRs on software drivers. We trace and analyze this process using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results indicate that component makers went through a learning process, which led some to realize how selectively waiving IPRs may be beneficial for their business. We uncover customer demand pull as the initial trigger and observe how a positive feedback loop sets in subsequently, leading to a further increase in the use of selective revealing. Overall, we find that openness develops into a new dimension of competition. We discuss the implication of our findings for research on open innovation and highlight how they impact managers in practice. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60016621"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56140726700", "authid": "56140726700", "authname": "Sch\u00f6berl S.", "surname": "Sch\u00f6berl", "given-name": "Simone", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027030"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36439193000", "authid": "36439193000", "authname": "Alexy O.", "surname": "Alexy", "given-name": "Oliver", "initials": "O.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

It presents three empirical studies that will enable managers, scholars, and policymakers to better interpret patenting activity. Such understanding is important since a misinterpretation of patenting activity leads to inefficient technology management in companies and to inadequate innovation policy. I analyze how the use (and abuse) of features of the patent system by private companies are related to patent filing motives. For this purpose, I analyze applications at the German patent office. It emerges that more than 50 percent of all filings involve applicant-induced delays. Further analysis reveals that the major reasons why firms cause these delays are to decrease the transparency of their own patent portfolios and to gain time to reevaluate the value of potential patent grants. Whereas patent applications that are withdrawn after reevaluation by the applicant create a lesser burden for the patent office, patents filed solely to decrease transparency give cause for concern because private and social welfare losses may result. An analysis of how the internal organization of patent management is related to firms' patent filing motives suggests that although filing motives are mostly driven by technology characteristics, some motives are also significantly associated with patent management structure. Many firms exhibit a highly professional patent management which is predominately guided by their senior executives. This group of firms attributes above-average importance to the strategic usage of patents, e.g. for decreasing the transparency of their patent portfolios or increasing their bargaining power. I also investigate the mechanics of patent arms races, which have been identified as a major reason for the increased complexity of the patent landscape in many sectors. My findings suggest that the perceived ineffectiveness of individual patents leads firms to file even more patents. Competitors are likely to react by increasing their patenting in turn. The result is a patent portfolio race, which can yield a suboptimal outcome in the long run. For managers, this means that increasing patent output may yield temporary advantages but can also create a dynamic similar to that of a price war, creating a potential prisoner's dilemma, which might decrease the effectiveness and efficiency of the innovation process.", "aggregation_type": "Book", "subtype": "bk", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55142495400", "authid": "55142495400", "authname": "Jell F.", "surname": "Jell", "given-name": "Florian", "initials": "F."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J."}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

First, they make it more attractive to join a network the larger its installed base. Second, they create incentives for network members to actively recruit new members. Despite indications that the latter \"peer effect\" can be more important for network growth than the installed-base effect, it has so far been largely ignored in the literature. We address this gap using game-theoretical models. When all early adopters can band together to exert peer influence-an assumption that fits, e.g., the case of firms supporting a technical standard-we find that the peer effect induces additional growth of the network by a factor. When, in contrast, individuals exert peer influence in small groups of size n, the increase in network size is by an additive constant-which, for small networks, can amount to a large relative increase. The difference between small, local, personal networks and large, global, anonymous networks arises endogenously from our analysis. Fundamentally, the first type of networks is \"tie-reinforcing,\" the other, \"tie-creating\". We use survey data from users of the Internet services, Skype and eBay, to illustrate the main logic of our theoretical results. As predicted by the model, we find that the peer effect matters strongly for the network of Skype users-which effectively consists of numerous small sub-networks-but not for that of eBay users. Since many network goods give rise to small, local networks, our findings bear relevance to the economics of network goods and related social networks in general. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60016621"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35204847100", "authid": "35204847100", "authname": "Block J.", "surname": "Block", "given-name": "J\u00f6rn", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011891"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022265"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

To this end, we conduct and analyze a series of discrete choice experiments with 319 managers within a leading international communications equipment company.

They are often characterized as relying on low-quality patents, an assessment that, if correct, would imply that eradicating such patents would effectively terminate the NPE business. In this paper, we shed light on this issue by empirically analyzing NPEs' patent acquisitions. We draw on a unique dataset of 392 U.S. patents acquired by known NPEs between 1997 and 2006, which we compare to three control groups of 784 U.S. patents each acquired by practicing firms. We find that the probability that a traded patent is acquired by an NPE rather than a practicing entity increases in the scope of the patent, in the patent density of its technology field and, contrary to common belief, in the patent's technological quality. Our findings thus support recent theoretical propositions about the NPE business model, showing that NPEs procure patents that are more likely to be infringed, harder to substitute for, and robust to legal challenges. The fact that NPE-acquired patents are of significantly higher quality than those in the control group implies that elevating minimum patent quality will not put an end to the NPE business, and suggests that this business is sustainable in the long run. We furthermore discuss the fact that NPEs are peculiar players on markets for technology insofar as they are solely interested in the exclusion right, not in the underlying knowledge.

For new product development, the interplay of marketing and R&D has been intensively researched. In contrast, for capturing value, this interplay has been largely neglected in the literature. To fill this gap, we study choices by marketing and R&D managers regarding activities aimed at appropriating profits from new products. We study, in detail, how managers perceive the effectiveness of product-related patents, overall patent portfolio size, marketing, sales and services quality, lead time, and contributions to open standards. We conducted discrete choice experiments with 143 managers working in R&D or marketing functions in upper and middle management in a leading communications equipment firm, and analyzed the resulting data by comparing marginal effects of rank-ordered mixed logit models between the two groups. We find that choices of R&D and marketing functions on how to capture the most value differ strongest on the mechanism that is perceived as most important by R&D managers, lead time advantages. Top management needs to consider and deal with these diverging perceptions when formulating business strategies on value capture. \u00a9 1988-2012 IEEE.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197216952", "authid": "57197216952", "authname": "Fischer T.", "surname": "Fischer", "given-name": "Timo", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

They are often characterized as relying on low-quality patents, an assessment that, if correct, would imply that eradicating such patents would effectively terminate the troll business. In this paper, we shed light on this issue by empirically analyzing trolls' patent acquisitions. We draw on a unique dataset of 565 patents acquired by known patent trolls between 1997 and 2007, which we compare to 1,130 patents acquired by practicing firms. Our findings regarding patent characteristics support recent theoretical propositions about the troll business model. Trolls focus on patents that have a broad scope and that lie in patent thickets. Surprisingly, and contrary to common belief, we find that troll patents are of significantly higher quality than those in the control group. This result implies that elevating minimum patent quality will not put an end to the patent troll business, and suggests that it is sustainable in the long run. Furthermore, we discuss the fact that trolls are peculiar players on markets for technology insofar as they are solely interested in the exclusion right, not in the underlying knowledge.

We address this gap, studying how existing OSS code is reused and serves as an input to further OSS development. Our findings are based on a survey with 686 responses from OSS developers. As the most interesting results, our multivariate analyses of developers' code reuse behavior point out that developers with larger personal networks within the OSS community and those who have experience in a greater number of OSS projects reuse more, presumably because both network size and a broad project experience facilitate local search for reusable artifacts. Moreover, we find that a development paradigm that calls for releasing an initial functioning version of the software early-as the \"credible promise\" in OSS-leads to increased reuse.

Yet, the expected positive association between risk and return, familiar from financial markets, is elusive. Measuring risk as the variance of a series of accounting-based returns, Bowman obtained the puzzling result of a negative association between risk and mean return. This finding, known as the Bowman paradox, has spawned a remarkable number of publications, and various explanations have been suggested. The present study contributes to this literature by showing that skewness of individual firm' return distributions has a considerable spurious effect on the empirically estimated mean-variance relationship. I devise a method to disentangle true and spurious effects, illustrate it using simulations, and apply it to empirical data. It turns out that the size of the spurious effect is such that, on average, it explains the larger part of the observed negative relationship. My results might thus help to reconcile mean-variance approaches to risk-return analysis with other, ex-ante, approaches. In concluding, I show that the analysis of skewness is linked to all three streams of literature devoted to explaining the Bowman paradox. \u00a9 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "re", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15822422700", "authid": "15822422700", "authname": "Henkel J.", "surname": "Henkel", "given-name": "Joachim", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60117649"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60019722"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "15822422700"}

The attacks usually come out of the blue, and companies' traditional lines of defense, designed for fighting off visible competitors, are essentially useless in this type of guerrilla warfare. Munich University of Technology's Henkel and London Business School's Reitzig offer five principles to help companies avoid attack. Move away from amassing huge patent portfolios for cross-licensing with competitors. Creating technological interdependence can work among competitors interested in exchanging technology. Patent sharks, however, want only monetary gains. Simplify standards and create more-modular designs. Companies become vulnerable when a shark's technology is built into a standard and they can neither stop using the technology nor switch to a feasible alternative. The solution is to simplify standards to minimize the number of irreplaceable core components and to create more-modular designs, so an infringing module can be swapped out for a legitimate one. Cooperate with competitors early in the R&D process. Disclosing unprotected Ideas to competitors can seem counterintuitive, but sharing information early on may help companies avoid developing products that are susceptible to attacks. Foster interdepartmental and intercompany cooperation. Assigning patent lawyers to projects from the start reduces the costs of protecting high-quality technologies down the line.

Scholars have identified two inefficiencies in legal practise (patentee-friendly injunctions and the granting of excessive damage awards) as drivers of these 'destructive' strategies, suggesting that policy changes can suppress the shark business in the future. Modelling interactions between sharks and manufacturers within a biform game, we show formally that the shark problem is more subtle from a theoretical managerial perspective and sustainable to policy changes in part. Patent extortion will remain a viable strategy in technologically crowded industries when sharks choose patents on inventions that (1) can be invented around rather easily before infringement, but (2) are sufficiently sophisticated to be upheld in court and (3) create significant mid-term switching costs for manufacturers after infringement. By presenting original data on all publicly reported cases of patent shark attacks, we provide empirical indications a) that different sharking strategies as predicted by theory exist in practise and b) that a significant share of professional shark firms already pursue strategies that are likely to remain sustainable after legal changes.

First, they make it attractive to join a network with a large installed base. Second, they make it attractive for network members to actively recruit new members. Despite indications that this \"peer effect\" can be more important for network growth than the installed-base effect, it has so far been largely ignored in the literature. We aim at closing this gap, using both survey data and a game-theoretical model. Comparing respondents' adoption of two distinct networks goods, we find that the peer effect matters strongly for small, but not for large networks. Results from model analysis support this finding. Under conservative assumptions, the increase in network size due to the peer effect is by an additive constant - which, for small networks, can amount to a large relative increase. The difference between small, local, and personal networks and large, global, anonymous networks thus arises endogenously from our model. In the duopoly case, we find that introducing the peer effect favors winner-take-all outcomes. We use the examples of the Internet services, Skype and eBay, for our empirical analysis and as illustration of our theoretical findings.

In this paper we show why patent sharks can operate profitably, why they are of growing concern, how manufacturers can forearm themselves against them, and which issues policy makers need to address. To do so, we map international indemnification rules with strategic rationales of small patent-holding firms and large manufacturers within a theoretical model. Our central finding is that the courts' unrealistic consideration of the trade-offs faced by inadvertent infringers is a central condition for sharks to operate profitably. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis is based on 25 interviews and a large-scale survey with 404 participants, performed at the telecommunications department of a multinational company and guided by the theoretical frameworks of Rogers (innovation diffusion) and Davis (Technology Acceptance Model). Our main findings concern the impact of the respondent's job function. They are consistent with theoretical considerations - and still rather surprising. Distinguishing between developers, testers, architects, project managers, and managers, we find that software testers are generally most favorable towards heightening OSS activities, followed by software architects and managers. Apart from project managers, developers are actually least favorable towards increased corporate OSS engagement, despite their large experience in working on OSS. Since developers constitute both the basic level of software development and the largest of the named groups, this finding leads us to question that OSS is a generally supported grassroots movement.

Defying conventional wisdom on the negative effects of uncompensated spillovers, innovative users also often openly reveal their innovations to competing users and to manufacturers. Rival users are thus in a position to reproduce the innovation in-house and benefit from using it, and manufacturers are in a position to refine the innovation and sell it to all users, including competitors of the user revealing its innovation. In this paper, we explore the incentives that users might have to freely reveal their proprietary innovations. We then develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users' decisions to reveal or hide their proprietary information. We find that, under realistic parameter constellations, free revealing pays. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This research examines the influence of a venture's learning proficiency on the relationship between venture relatedness and operations autonomy. Results from 145 ICVs operating in 72 parent corporations indicate that learning proficiency strongly moderates the relationship between parent-venture relatedness and autonomy, but the direction of the moderating effect depends on the type of relatedness being considered, i.e., either market familiarity or product similarity.

Using data collected from 145 ICVs operating in 72 corporate parents, this research reveals that corporations with more attractive core businesses grant greater planning autonomy to their ICVs\u2019 managers, and planning autonomy contributes to ICV performance. Additional results reveal the moderating effects within our structural model of venture manager experience and the similarity of the ICV\u2019s product to those of other businesses within the corporation. Considered collectively, this research demonstrates why corporations that \u201cneed\u201d their ICVs to be successful \u2013 because of poor prospects in their core businesses \u2013 are most likely to mismanage them. Unattractive core business prospects can be viewed as justifying corporate managers\u2019 involvement in the direct management of their firms\u2019 ICVs. However, venture planning autonomy is needed to avoid placing undue expectations on ICVs as the \u201csaviors\u201d of corporate performance. By extension, this need for autonomy is also anticipated to apply to other entrepreneurial contexts where experimentation and learning are significant concerns (e.g., business incubators, corporate venture capital investments, new venture divisions). Plain English Summary: This research demonstrates how and why corporations that have attractive core business operations are most likely to be good corporate parents to their internal corporate ventures (ICVs), and vice versa. In a sense, when it comes to internal corporate venturing, \u201cthe rich corporations get richer, and the poor corporations get poorer.\u201d Parent corporations with more attractive core business prospects were found to grant greater planning autonomy to the managers of their ICVs, and autonomy is needed to give ICV managers the discretion and flexibility they need when navigating their ventures though unchartered business territory. Overall, this research demonstrates the importance of corporate managers (1) granting ICV managers autonomy in planning their venture operations, (2) being willing to consider engaging in internal corporate venturing even though their firms\u2019 existing, core business operations may be attractive (i.e., before these ICVs \u201cneed\u201d to be successful), and (3) not putting too much pressure on ICVs to \u201cperform,\u201d and avoiding meddling in the management of those ventures, when prospects in the corporation\u2019s core business are unattractive. We argue that autonomy is likely efficacious in most entrepreneurial contexts where experimentation and learning are significant concerns (e.g., business incubators, corporate venture capital investments, new venture divisions).", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602113346", "authid": "6602113346", "authname": "Covin J.G.", "surname": "Covin", "given-name": "Jeffrey G.", "initials": "J.G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60010783"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24481294100", "authid": "24481294100", "authname": "Garrett R.P.", "surname": "Garrett", "given-name": "Robert P.", "initials": "R.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60028599"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/14053594000", "authid": "14053594000", "authname": "Bouncken R.B.", "surname": "Bouncken", "given-name": "Ricarda B.", "initials": "R.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023208"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56286807200", "authid": "56286807200", "authname": "Ratzmann M.", "surname": "Ratzmann", "given-name": "Martin", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023208"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/58606593500", "authid": "58606593500", "authname": "Muhammad M.", "surname": "Muhammad", "given-name": "Malcolm", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "130217463"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "24481294100"}

Although this metatheoretical perspective overcomes some problems with previous views and helps to identify the essence of a construct, the level of abstraction required by this approach leaves unanswered questions related to how social entrepreneurs leverage opportunities. The purpose of this paper is to create a framework to describe social entrepreneurial opportunities in a way that facilitates action and decision-making by social entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: Through adapting Davidsson's (2015) deconstruction of the opportunity construct and using it to inform the pragmatist view of entrepreneurs as theory-testing scientists, this paper develops a framework for understanding social entrepreneurial opportunities. The paper explores the idea that social opportunities are composed of external enablers, a new social venture idea, and social opportunity confidence, and integrates the existing literature on social opportunities into this framework. Findings: Using the framework developed, the authors advance a template of questions, hypotheses and quasi-experimental means that social entrepreneurs can use to determine how to move forward in social opportunity actualization. The authors also expand three categories of research questions that scholars may explore to extend the practical and theoretical understanding of social opportunities. Originality/value: This work is among the first to adopt the pragmatist lens to elucidate social opportunities in a practical way. It takes an important first step in offering a means for social entrepreneurs to investigate when or where the requisite components of a social entrepreneurial opportunity may exist.

Drawing on family development theory, we offer midrange reasoning about the impact of enterprising family dynamics\u2014such as the birth of a child or children leaving home\u2014on the motivation for corporate venturing and its changes over time. Moreover, our model also accounts for the contingent effect of ownership and business developmental dimensions. Finally, we predict that motivation for corporate venturing can, in turn, spur the development of the enterprising family. Managerial summary: Overcoming the idea that family firms are either very or minimally entrepreneurial, we focus on the enterprising family and consider its development to explain the motivation toward corporate venturing. We look at the evolution of the roles and norms of family members over time and predict that motivation for venturing increases with family growth until the moment in which a succession takes place and the younger generation receives the baton. We also consider how changes in the ownership structure and business growth influence the relationship between family development and motivation for venturing. The latter, in turn, can trigger the development of the enterprising family itself, with its structure and norms. Our work, in sum, depicts the enterprising family as a springboard for repeated acts of entrepreneurship across generations.

Findings \u2013 Results indicate that respondents perceive the signal provided by compilation reports, review reports and audit reports as increasing in reliability and are more likely to invest in a venture providing reports with that increasing reliability.

Consequently, potential investors may require less additional information from entrepreneurs with audited financial statements when conducting due diligence investigations.

These ventures, however, often fail, and previous research has revealed surprisingly little about the antecedents to performance for this strategically important phenomenon. Using resource dependence theory and the resource-based view, a model is developed wherein the positive relationship between top management support and the internal corporate venture's (ICV) initial strategic asset endowment is moderated by the amount of the venture's operations autonomy. We then argue how top management support, the venture's initial strategic asset endowment, and parent-venture product similarity are related to ICV performance. Primary data were collected from 72 firms which furnished data on 145 ICVs. The results suggest that increases in the level of support provided by top management leads to higher levels of initial strategic assets endowed in the corporate venture. This relationship, however, is weakened the more corporate parents give their ICVs operations autonomy. Further, top management's support of the corporate venture, as well as the level of initial strategic assets endowed to the venture, increases the subsequent performance of the ICV. The performance benefit of these initial strategic assets, however, is lower the more there is an overlap between the parent's and the venture's products. \u00a9 2013 Product Development & Management Association.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24481294100", "authid": "24481294100", "authname": "Garrett R.P.", "surname": "Garrett", "given-name": "Robert P.", "initials": "R.P.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013402"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602642757", "authid": "6602642757", "authname": "Neubaum D.O.", "surname": "Neubaum", "given-name": "Donald O.", "initials": "D.O.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122767"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "24481294100"}

Governance structure is a well-understood knowledge protection strategy designed to reduce knowledge leakage concerns and thereby encourage desired knowledge transfers in two-party R&D alliances. Whether governance structure can be an important balancing mechanism for R&D alliances with multiple partner firms, or multilateral R&D alliances, however, requires further study. Because increasing the number of alliance partners introduces additional complexities to managing an alliance, the appropriate governance mechanism for a multilateral R&D alliance is likely to differ from that for a bilateral alliance. Drawing insights from social exchange theory, we explore governance decisions in multilateral R&D alliances. First, we examine the potential for variance between multilateral and bilateral R&D alliances in governance decisions as a means of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection. Results based on our analysis of 2,423 R&D alliances, 1,690 bilateral and 733 multilateral, are consistent with predictions drawn from social exchange theory. We next focus on three-partner R&D alliances, or trilateral R&D alliances, and compare governance mechanisms between two types of trilateral R&D alliances: chain and net. We find that equity governance structures are more likely to be used in net-based than in chain-based trilateral R&D alliances; we also find that alliance scope moderates the relationship between the type of alliance and governance structure. Finally, we find that multilateral R&D alliances with predicted (aligned) governance structures perform better, in terms of alliance longevity, than those with misaligned structures. \u00a92012 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23393282100", "authid": "23393282100", "authname": "Li D.", "surname": "Li", "given-name": "Dan", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138278"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003796845", "authid": "7003796845", "authname": "Eden L.", "surname": "Eden", "given-name": "Lorraine", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138449"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8092411400", "authid": "8092411400", "authname": "Hitt M.A.", "surname": "Hitt", "given-name": "Michael A.", "initials": "M.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60138449"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56111740200", "authid": "56111740200", "authname": "Ireland R.D.", "surname": "Ireland", "given-name": "R.

Moderated regression analysis based on data collected from 111 manufacturing firms supports the hypotheses. Top management risk taking and market responsiveness positively predict the use of a pioneering strategy. Strategic learning self efficacy makes market pioneering more palatable to risk-averse top managers who might not otherwise engage in pioneering.

The exhibition of strategic adaptability - the ability of a firm to alter its alignment with the environment through reactive and proactive behaviors (Evans, 1991) - is a function of the goodness-of-fit that exists between the capabilities of a firm and the demands imposed by its relevant industry context (Burgelman & Grove, 1996). When firm capabilities are well aligned with industry success factors, those capabilities constitute strategic assets for the firm, or resources that lead to the achievement of competitive success in that context (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993). The possession of strategic assets thus contributes to a state of adaptation, defined by Chakravarthy (1982) as a state in which an organization exhibits the capacity to survive the conditions of its changing environment. Because of the constantly shifting nature of the environment, a state of adaptation is not a permanent settling point for the organization, but rather a moving target for the organization as it attempts to remain \"mapped on\" to the exigencies of the environment. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We explore why rivals initiate a specific competitive action at a particular time and situation. Drawing from the philosophy of action literature, we introduce the concept of competitive rationales to examine the primary reasons that cause tactical actions. Given the rapid exchanges characterizing tactical competitive dynamics, we conducted an inductive, multicase study to explore the reasons behind over 800 discrete tactical decisions carried out by 9 professional basketball coaches during 15 basketball games. To garner insight, we develop a conceptual framework revealing their types and scope. Even during intense head-to-head rivalry, most rationales were not rivalrous but were instead organizational\u2014to optimize resource use, strategic consistency, and reputation\u2014or social\u2014to manage relationships. Moreover, the three main types of rationales varied in scope, extending beyond immediate competitive situations and rivals to address longer term, strategic outcomes, and assorted stakeholders. Thus, our analysis reveals these rationales to be complex and potentially difficult for rivals to decipher. It also recasts each component of the dominant awareness-motivation-capability (AMC) model of rivalry, suggesting that awareness is challenged by subtle rationales, motivation drives not only action but also forbearance, and capability is both a requirement and product of action.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35177081600", "authid": "35177081600", "orcid": "0000-0002-2196-5413", "authname": "Andrevski G.", "surname": "Andrevski", "given-name": "Goce", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60016005"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7407279089", "authid": "7407279089", "authname": "Miller D.", "surname": "Miller", "given-name": "Danny", "initials": "D."}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56003957000", "authid": "56003957000", "orcid": "0000-0001-5755-2939", "authname": "Le Breton-Miller I.", "surname": "Le Breton-Miller", "given-name": "Isabelle", "initials": "I.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002970"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602560326", "authid": "6602560326", "authname": "Ferrier W.", "surname": "Ferrier", "given-name": "Walter", "initials": "W.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60015941"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "35177081600"}

Spin is positively related to Neuroticism and is maladaptive, with well-documented deleterious effects on social functioning. The perceptual processes associated with spin and how spin emerges are less well-understood. The present research examines the interpersonal perception of individuals with higher spin and tests whether these perceptual processes explain the association of spin with Neuroticism. Method: 267 students participated in a 20-day event contingent recording procedure, reporting on social interactions via mobile application. Participants' perceptions of others' behavior, their own affect, and their own behavior were measured within and across interactions. Results: We examined the affective and behavioral responses of individuals with higher spin to perceptions of others' behaviors. Individuals with higher spin showed greater affective and behavioral reactivity to perceptions of others' communal (agreeable-quarrelsome) behavior. Neuroticism predicted greater affective reactivity (i.e., steeper slopes between event-level perceived communion and negative affect), which in turn predicted higher spin. Conclusions: Individuals with higher spin may have an interpersonal style characterized by greater reactivity to perceptions of others' communal behavior. These individuals' behavioral lability may reflect underlying emotional dysregulation. These processes may ultimately interfere with the formation and maintenance of social bonds.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203649257", "authid": "57203649257", "orcid": "0000-0001-7792-3346", "authname": "Clegg K.A.", "surname": "Clegg", "given-name": "Kayleigh Ann", "initials": "K.A.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002494"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202066634", "authid": "57202066634", "authname": "Moskowitz D.S.", "surname": "Moskowitz", "given-name": "D.

Managerial crosscutting diversity exhibits a U-shaped relationship to performance while board crosscutting diversity moderates this nonlinear relationship. Specifically, at high levels of board crosscutting diversity, we find a J-shaped relationship such that firms experience low, declining performance from zero to low levels of managerial diversity but rapidly increasing positive performance from moderate to high levels of managerial diversity. While firms with homogeneous management and a homogenous board observe average performance, firms exhibit the lowest performance when they have incongruity between level of management diversity and board diversity. In addition, our study shows that these interaction effects are stronger for firms that utilize formalized mentoring practices as a 'managing diversity' mechanism such that the highest performance institutions were configured with high managerial diversity, high board diversity, and formal diversity mentoring for minority managers.

However, there is a need to understand factors that enable firms to undertake competitive actions. In this study, we focus on two antecedents of competitive behavior of firms: (1) access to network resources and (2) use of information technology (IT). We argue that while network structure provides firms with the opportunity to tap into external resources, the extent to which they are actually exploited depends on firms' IT-enabled capability. We develop a theoretical model that examines the relationships between IT-enabled capability, network structure, and competitive action. We test the model using secondary data, about 12 major automakers over 16 years from 1988 to 2003. We find that network structure rich in structural holes has a positive direct effect on firms' ability to introduce a greater number and a wider range of competitive actions. However, the effect of dense network structure is contingent on firms' IT-enabled capability. Firms benefit from dense network structure only when they develop a strong IT-enabled capability. Our results suggest that IT-enabled capability plays both a substitutive role, when firms do not have advantageous access to brokerage opportunities, and a complementary role, when firms are embedded in dense network structure, in the relationship between network structure and competitive actions. \u00a9 2010 INFORMS.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36729379200", "authid": "36729379200", "authname": "Chi L.", "surname": "Chi", "given-name": "Lei", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116341"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004119139", "authid": "7004119139", "authname": "Ravichandran T.", "surname": "Ravichandran", "given-name": "T.", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116341"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35177081600", "authid": "35177081600", "authname": "Andrevski G.", "surname": "Andrevski", "given-name": "Goce", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116580"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "35177081600"}

Previous research has not specified whether organizations use direct competitors or other comparable organizations as referents for forming their aspirations. In this study, it is argued that organizations form their social aspirations based on two types of interorganizational comparisons: competitive and striving. In competitive comparisons, an organization compares its current performance against that of its current direct competitors. When relative performance is poor, these organizations plan more extensive and more radical change. However, the study shows that organizations that are performing well relative to competitors do not necessarily become inertial, as theory suggests. Rather, organizations engage in striving comparisons by comparing their current performance against the performance of organizations to which they strive to be like in the future. The analyses show that organizations with large striving discrepancies are driven to more extensive and more radical change, even if they are performing well compared to current competitors.

We conceptualize apprentices as hybrid (a combination of internal and external) change agents at lower echelons. We examine how apprentices in the Swiss VET system are key to integrating external knowledge (through school-based education) with internal knowledge (through on-the-job training) and moderating the influence of organizational innovation on technological innovation. Drawing on a sample of 1240 firms from a representative Swiss Innovation Survey, we show that apprentices leverage the positive association between innovations in a firm\u2019s business processes and organization of work with incremental innovations. With the description of a new mechanism that shows the significant role of apprentices on firms\u2019 technological innovation activities and evidence for supportive associations between key variables, we contribute to the understanding of the influence of VET on innovation in firms.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56574407000", "authid": "56574407000", "orcid": "0000-0002-1745-520X", "authname": "Rupietta C.", "surname": "Rupietta", "given-name": "Christian", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60203645"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60022995"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55117305800", "authid": "55117305800", "authname": "Meuer J.", "surname": "Meuer", "given-name": "Johannes", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025858"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202353167", "authid": "57202353167", "authname": "Backes-Gellner U.", "surname": "Backes-Gellner", "given-name": "Uschi", "initials": "U.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012614"}]}], "openaccess": "1"}, "final_result": "55117305800"}

Although a majority of studies have focused on assigned expatriates (AEs), only recently have researchers expanded the scope of analysis by focusing on self-initiated expatriates (SIEs). For SIEs, research has identified job embeddedness as a key explanatory concept for early repatriation without yet acknowledging its potential to also explain the early expatriation of AEs. However, because AEs and SIEs differ in important motivational and behavioral aspects, the lack of comparative studies prohibits a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which job embeddedness influences early repatriation. We build on belongingness theory to conceptualize early repatriation as a compensatory reaction of expatriates to an inhibited need to belong. Using a unique sample of 345 expatriates from 40 countries, we show that off-the-job embeddedness is more important for explaining the repatriation intention of AEs than of SIEs, whereas on-the-job embeddedness is more important for explaining the repatriation of SIEs compared to AEs.

Yet our current understanding of the complementarities within HPWS remains limited for two reasons: First, the dominant theoretical perspectives on HPWS provide a landscape of theoretical possibilities rather than an understanding of different possibilities through which HPWS generate positive effects on performance; and second, the literature on HPWS merely proposes several seemingly equally important HR practices. This article explores the internal nature of HPWS by integrating a configurational perspective of core, peripheral, and nonessential HR practices with a typology of complementarities. Analyzing 530 UK-based firms using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), I identify four frequently implemented HPWS consistently associated with high labor productivity. The complementarities within all HPWS combine pairs of core HR practices with sets of peripheral HR practices. Moreover, the complementarities within three of the four HPWS rely on firms\u2019 avoidance of implementing certain HR practices. The results suggest that the synergies of HPWS arise from efficient complementarities and virtuous overlaps, and reveal the significance of achieving high performance by not implementing HR practices. This article thus advances a new perspective on HPWSs, highlighting the challenges involved in successfully designing HPWS. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55117305800", "authid": "55117305800", "authname": "Meuer J.", "surname": "Meuer", "given-name": "Johannes", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025858"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "55117305800"}

Most research analyses innovation systems taking a national, regional or sectoral perspective, following a 'technological imperative'. Yet changes in institutional conditions and the importance of non-technological innovation question the accuracy and the relevance of the existing boundaries of innovation systems. These developments ask for a better understanding of how innovation systems integrate within and across different levels. Drawing on a novel combination of configurational and econometric analysis, we analyse 384 Swiss firms and identify five co-existing innovation systems: two generic innovation systems, the autarkic and the knowledge-internalisation; one regional innovation system, the protected hierarchy; and two sectoral innovation systems, the public sciences and the organised learning. The generic innovation systems entail the 'Science, Technology and Innovation' (STI) and the 'Doing, Interacting and Using' (DUI) learning modes. These systems are structurally distinct and do not integrate. In contrast, all regional and sectoral innovation systems integrate the learning modes of the generic innovation systems and complement them with idiosyncratic elements. The perspective on co-existing innovation systems that we develop here indicates the existence of two layers of innovation systems: a 'central' layer that hosts generic innovation systems and that constitutes the foundation for a second 'surface' layer that hosts regional and sectoral innovation systems. We discuss the implications of layers of co-existing innovation systems for policy-makers and future research.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55117305800", "authid": "55117305800", "authname": "Meuer J.", "surname": "Meuer", "given-name": "Johannes", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012614"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56574407000", "authid": "56574407000", "authname": "Rupietta C.", "surname": "Rupietta", "given-name": "Christian", "initials": "C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012614"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202353167", "authid": "57202353167", "authname": "Backes-Gellner U.", "surname": "Backes-Gellner", "given-name": "Uschi", "initials": "U.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012614"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "55117305800"}

Emerging in the shadow of research on technological innovation, growing evidence points towards the inter-firm relation as an important locus of innovation.

This study takes a configurational perspective to identify archetypes of inter-firm relations leading to the implementation of management innovation. Using fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to analyse 56 firm partnerships in China's biopharmaceutical industry, the empirical evidence identifies four such discrete inter-firm archetypes: organic coalitions, bureaucratic foundations, coalitions of intense interdependency and reciprocal foundations.

Due to the complexity of the products and the large range of separate scientific disciplines required for identifying, defining, and solving problems, the process of biopharmaceutical drug design here is identified as a suitable research field. Based on an organization-population analysis of a biopharmaceutical High Tech Park, four conditions for the application of SBN concepts are being carved out. First, network elements need clearly identifiable objectives and functions to avoid interference with other system elements. Second, the presence of single coordination devices enhances the functional capability of the network, as does a unified logic underlying its technology, norms, and language. At last, a sufficient degree of system inherent viability in the form of independence from external shocks is required.

We argue that the \"othering\" and scapegoating involved in organizational deadlocks can be driven by fantasmatic identifications that dim the prospects for discerning and exploring areas of common cause. A condition of possibility of breaking such deadlocks is, conversely, a traversing of the fantasies that cement the impasse. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36992259000", "authid": "36992259000", "authname": "Lok J.", "surname": "Lok", "given-name": "Jaco", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60028333"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004818710", "authid": "7004818710", "authname": "Willmott H.", "surname": "Willmott", "given-name": "Hugh", "initials": "H.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60023998"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "36992259000"}

First, there is a tendency to preserve the dualism of structural constraint and free agency. Second, they tend to rely on functionalist explanations to account for institutional change. It is argued that a social constructionist theory of institutional change that frames institutional stability and change as dialectically related opposites has the potential to overcome these two significant shortcomings. Mainly drawing upon Berger & Luckmann (1967)'s seminal account of social constructionism, which paradoxically forms an important part of new institutional theory's microsociological underpinnings, the paper identifies and explores 10 sources of institutional stability. These sources are developed into a proposition framework for institutional stability analysis that can be used to explore questions of institutional change. The application of this framework to the everyday example of 'queuing' is used to illustrate the paper's main contention that it is through stability analysis that specific institutional change sequences can be better understood.", "aggregation_type": "Conference Proceeding", "subtype": "cp", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36992259000", "authid": "36992259000", "authname": "Lok J.", "surname": "Lok", "given-name": "Jaco", "initials": "J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60112768"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "36992259000"}

Qualitative analyses of world leader speeches are used to examine how health-focused leaders\u2019 language is. Media attention with sentiment analysis about each leader\u2019s handling of the pandemic is also used to show how others reacted to leaders. Findings: Countries with female leaders showed fewer pandemic deaths than those led by male leaders. The interaction between leader gender and country collectivism predicted death. Media sentiment was more favorable for women leaders than men leaders. Practical implications: During times of crises, women\u2019s more careful tendencies keep their constituents safer than their male counterparts. Country collectivism also aids male leaders in keeping constituents safe. Social implications: The present study helps unpack when women leaders thrive and outperform their male counterparts.

Drawing on expectation states theory, we identify contexts in which each type of CEO succession with gender change can have positive effects on strategic change and subsequent firm performance, depending on whether the degree of gender parity in the context is sufficient for the new CEO to enact strategic changes. Consistent with our arguments, we report findings from Chinese and US samples showing that in the presence of high environmental dynamism female-to-male CEO succession yields greater strategic change. Conversely, when environmental dynamism is low, it is male-to-female CEO succession that brings about greater strategic change. Furthermore, in the Chinese context, we found that female-to-male CEO succession in state-owned companies results in greater strategic change, whereas male-to-female CEO succession has the same effect in privately-owned settings.

This challenge stems from societal-level conflicts between advantaged and marginalized groups which generate a paradoxical tension between the values of diversity and meritocracy. The diversity-meritocracy paradox manifests in interaction as an identity validation-threat system so that events benefitting marginalized groups threaten advantaged groups and vice versa. However, diversity and meritocracy are also interrelated, and fulfilling each of these values supports the other through their beneficial effects on organizational justice. Managing the paradox entails supporting perceptions of process integrity with diversity practices while supporting perceptions of individual competence with meritocracy practices. Balanced combinations of practices create organizational ambidexterity to fulfil diversity and meritocracy pressures simultaneously.

While discrimination and diversity are very different constructs, it is often informative to study them together, because when people recognize each other's diversity, this can result in bias, stereotyping, and discrimination. We conducted bibliographic searches for terms related to discrimination and diversity as well as a manual search through every title and abstract published in HRM over the last 60 years to assess article relevance. The search resulted in 135 research articles with 136 unique studies (i.e., samples) which are reviewed in this article. Sex and race are the demographics that have been examined the most in HRM, while religion has been examined the least. Moreover, the number of studies examining lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) employees in the workplace in HRM has grown quickly within the past 10 years, culminating in a recent meta-analysis.

More important, we also find support for a longitudinal-based mediation model in which strategic change frequency in terms of diversification/refocusing actions (Time 2) transmits the positive effect of TMT surface-level diversity (Time 1) to long-term financial performance (Time 3) without accounting for any moderated conditions suggesting that mediation models warrant more utilization in the upper echelons research and internationalization research domains.

In a panel study (2003\u20132015), we find that TMT relationship-related faultline strength (especially educational-level) negatively influences strategic change whereas TMT task-related faultline strength positively affects strategic change. Environmental dynamism reduces the negative effect of TMT gender and educational-level faultline strengths on strategic change while in fact revealing a notable positive effect between TMT age-faultline strength and strategic change. Additionally, environmental dynamism strengthens the positive effects of task-related TMT faultline strength on strategic change. We offer theoretical and practical implications to both the demographic faultlines and upper echelons research domains. Managerial summary: Top management teams (TMTs) in firms can fracture into subgroups based on demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and education level) as well as based on task-related characteristics (e.g., functional background, and tenure). We call the former relationship-related faultlines and the latter task-related faultlines. We predict and find that stronger relationship based faultlines hinders between subgroup cohesion, reducing TMTs' ability to initiate strategic change. We also predict and find that stronger task-related faultlines facilitate inter-subgroup knowledge-sharing, improving TMTs' ability to initiate strategic change.

This study aims to examine and provide a deeper understanding of individuals\u2019 negative reactions to similar others, thus highlighting the double-edged nature of demographic similarity which has historically predicted positive affective reactions. Design/methodology/approach: Using a survey design, the authors collected data from supervisor-subordinate dyads from multiple companies from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in Texas, USA. They used ordinary least squares regression and conditional process analysis to test the hypotheses, including a two-stage moderation and moderated mediation. Findings: Incorporating social context, i.e. minority status, as a moderator, the results show that ethno-racial minority leaders supervising ethno-racially similar subordinates were more vulnerable to relationship conflict than non-minority dyads. This, in turn, is linked to a reduction in the leaders\u2019 feelings of trust toward their ethno-racially similar subordinate. Originality/value: This study draws on social identity theory and status characteristics theory to explain the contradictory processes and outcomes associated with dyadic ethno-racial similarity and suggests the conditions under which dyad racial similarity is connected with unfavorable outcomes. This framework helps to broaden the boundary conditions of relational demography to provide a more nuanced explanation of when and why minority leaders in demographically similar hierarchical dyads experience more relationship conflict, which ultimately diminishes trust.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56880516600", "authid": "56880516600", "authname": "Miller C.D.", "surname": "Miller", "given-name": "Carliss D.", "initials": "C.D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025157"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006922380", "authid": "7006922380", "authname": "Richard O.C.", "surname": "Richard", "given-name": "Orlando C.", "initials": "O.C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60009415"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401568381", "authid": "7401568381", "authname": "Ford D.L.", "surname": "Ford", "given-name": "David L.", "initials": "D.L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60009415"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7006922380"}

They utilized hierarchical regression, (with the inclusion of two- and three-way interaction terms) to test their hypotheses and interaction effects. Findings: Negative mood and positive mood interacted to impact the level of relationship conflict experienced by subordinates. Subordinates' collectivism values strengthened the impact of the positive mood-negative mood interaction on relationship conflict. Mentoring and supervisor-subordinate dyad tenure moderated the relationship conflict to outcomes associations. Originality/value: The study goes beyond traditional relational demography research in order to offer new insights and perspectives on the causes and outcomes of relationship conflict at different hierarchical levels from an affective approach, specifically, moods theory.

Based on social exchange theory, we hypothesize that employees' levels of individualism, collectivism, and trust in supervisor influence the level of supervisory mentoring received. Moreover, mentoring influences employees' affective commitment and intention to quit, as well as mediates the relationships between the proposed antecedents and outcomes. Using structural equation modeling to examine these relationships, we find that within supervisor-subordinate dyads, subordinates report more mentoring when they have collectivist personal values and trust their supervisor. Additionally, more mentoring is positively related to subordinates' affective commitment towards the organizations and negatively related to their intention to quit. We also find that mentoring mediate the relationship between both collectivism values and trust in supervisors and both organizational commitment and intention to quit. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc.

When considering short-term performance outcomes, we predict a curvilinear relationship between diversity and performance (i.e., firm productivity). Although we find evidence of a U-shaped relationship between racial diversity and productivity, the relationship is stronger in service-oriented relative to manufacturing-oriented industries and in more stable vs. volatile environments. For longer-term profitability, we propose and find support for more of apositive linear relationship between diversity and performance (i.e., Tobin's q) than a nonlinear one. This linear effect is stronger and more positive in munificent compared to resource-scare environments. Thus, we aid in reconciling existing, often contradictory, studies by demonstrating the potential short-term vs. long-term impact of racial diversity on performance.

We consider the ways that two of the forms, ethnocentric and modernistic, can lead to problems in decision-making and creativity in diverse organizations. We then present cosmopolitan communication, discussing how the form can lead to positive outcomes in diverse organizations, why it works well, and how change agents can encourage communication that draws on this form.

The few studies there are show inconsistent results. For example, most field work - consistent with social identity theory notions - shows that cultural diversity, in isolation has negative organizational consequences. Only a few laboratory studies, however - consistent with information and decision-making theories - show that diversity in groups relates to favourable organizational outcomes. As social identity theory suggests, we find that top management team (TMT) age heterogeneity, in isolation, relates negatively to return on assets. On sales growth (i.e. organizational growth), the relationship is positive, lending support for information and decision-making theories. However, we find a curvilinear relationship between TMT age heterogeneity and sales growth, supporting both the mid-range theories. More specifically, TMT age heterogeneity is positively related to sales growth at low and medium levels and negatively related to sales growth at high levels. In addition, results reveal that context moderates linear and non-linear relationships. The results provide evidence of the importance of cultural diversity in TMTs for competitive advantage but also suggest the complexities of increasing it to observe these benefits.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006922380", "authid": "7006922380", "authname": "Richard O.", "surname": "Richard", "given-name": "Orlando C.", "initials": "O.C.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60009415"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507357612", "authid": "6507357612", "authname": "Shelor R.", "surname": "Shelor", "given-name": "Roger M.", "initials": "R.M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60011132"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "7006922380"}

Stemming from behavioral theory and grounded in a cognitive perspective, which views organizational actions as being the results of decisions produced by groups of individual decision-makers, PFT research has mostly assumed the universal nature of cognition and decision-making processes. However, PFT also presumes that individual decision-makers bring with them different backgrounds and experiences. Hence, this paper offers propositions on how cultural differences in individualism-collectivism influence the major components of PFT, including the formation and revision of performance goals (aspiration levels), and search behaviors and risk preferences in response to gaps between goals and actual performance. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers theoretical propositions for the above purpose. Findings: This is not an empirical analysis. Originality/value: By integrating the individualism-collectivism differences framework into the PFT model, the authors answer previous calls to integrate concepts and frameworks from other theories into PFT while considering the role of cultural differences in aspiration-consequence relationships. Additionally, much of PFT research has focused on outcomes, while actual internal processes have remained unobserved. By focusing on how cultural differences influence various PFT processes, this conceptual analysis sheds light on the unobserved bounds of decision-makers' cognitions.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7102347626", "authid": "7102347626", "authname": "Rhee M.", "surname": "Rhee", "given-name": "Mooweon", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60016912"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201252931", "authid": "57201252931", "authname": "Alexandra V.", "surname": "Alexandra", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60018926"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35186505400", "authid": "35186505400", "orcid": "0000-0002-3889-0657", "authname": "Powell K.S.", "surname": "Powell", "given-name": "K.

Previous literature identifies cross-cultural contact and experiential contact-based training as effective in CQ development; however, individuals differ in their propensity to engage in and benefit from intergroup contact. Drawing on social dominance theory research and cultural learning models, I examine the relationships between individual social dominance orientation (SDO), the propensity to change stereotypes, and CQ development in the context of experiential cross-cultural training involving contact with a culturally different group. A pre- and postdesign study conducted among 122 postgraduate students demonstrated that SDO is directly and negatively related to the propensity to change stereotypes and indirectly and negatively related to CQ development following contact-based training. The propensity to change stereotypes mediated the negative relationship between SDO and CQ development. My findings here suggest that socially dominant individuals are less likely to benefit from experiential contact-based cross-cultural training; on the other hand, individuals with greater propensity to change stereotypes are likely to develop greater CQ.

In addition, we need to better understand how social beliefs are linked to ethical perception and the level of analysis at which social beliefs may best predict ethical perceptions. This research contributes to the cross-cultural ethical perception literature by examining the relationship of individual-level social cynicism belief, one of five universally endorsed social beliefs, together with individual social dominance orientation and the perception of unethical behavior. By means of two studies, we examine these relationships across societies that significantly differ on societal-level social cynicism belief. Using 371 business students from Russia and the U.S. in Study 1 and 268 professionals from Portugal and the U.S. in Study 2, we found that individual-level social cynicism belief was positively associated with social dominance orientation. Social dominance orientation, in turn, mediated the relationship between individual social cynicism belief and the perception of unethical behavior. Although we found significant societal-level differences in social cynicism belief in both studies, the relationships between individual-level social cynicism belief, social dominance orientation, and the perception of unethical behavior were structurally equivalent across societies in both studies, suggesting that societal-level differences did not significantly affect these relationships.

However, little is known about factors and processes supporting its development. In a longitudinal study involving pre-and postintervention measures of CQ, we explored the role of the individual perception of optimal cross-cultural contact and the experience of expectancy disconfirmation. The study was conducted among 212 management students and professionals who partook in an experiential CQ education intervention encompassing cross-cultural contact as part of a university management course. The results of our work reveal that the relationship between participants'perception of optimal cross-cultural contact and CQ development is mediated by the experience of expectancy disconfirmation. When participants perceived optimal cross-cultural contact, which involved a number of conditions including equal status among participants, personalized contact, establishment of common goals, and support of the contact by authorities, they were more likely to experience expectancy disconfirmation. In turn, greater experience of expectancy disconfirmation was associated with greater CQ development. Researchers, educators, and managers who understand the factors and processes supporting CQ development are better equipped to prepare individuals for greater effectiveness in a variety of cultural contexts. \u00a9 Academy of Management Learning & Education, 2013.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201252931", "authid": "57201252931", "authname": "Rosenblatt V.", "surname": "Rosenblatt", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60027627"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506885727", "authid": "6506885727", "authname": "Worthley R.", "surname": "Worthley", "given-name": "Reginald", "initials": "R.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60013791"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12139341300", "authid": "12139341300", "authname": "Macnab B.", "surname": "Macnab", "given-name": "Brent", "initials": "B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60025709"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "57201252931"}

Rooted in the definition of organizational corruption as misuse of power or position for personal or organizational gain, this work suggests that organizational corruption is driven by the individual and institutional tendency to structure societies as group-based social hierarchies. SDT describes a series of factors and processes across multiple levels of analysis that systemically contribute to the initiation and maintenance of social hierarchies and associated power inequalities, favoritism, and discrimination. I posit that the same factors and processes also contribute to individuals' lower awareness of the misuse of power and position within the social hierarchies, leading to the initiation and maintenance of organizational corruption. Specifically, individuals high in social dominance orientation, believing that they belong to superior groups, are likely to be less aware of corruption because of their feeling of entitlement to greater power and their desire to maintain dominance even if that requires exploiting others. Members of subordinate groups are also likely to have lower awareness of corruption if they show more favoritism toward dominant group members to enhance their sense of worth and preserve social order. Institutions contribute to lower awareness of corruption by developing and enforcing structures, norms, and practices that promote informational ambiguity and maximize focus on dominance and promotion. Dynamic coordination among individuals and institutions is ensured through the processes of person-environment fit and legitimizing beliefs, ideologies, or rationalizations. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201252931", "authid": "57201252931", "authname": "Rosenblatt V.", "surname": "Rosenblatt", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122671"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "57201252931"}

However, studies on the processes supporting the diffusion of global work values have been limited. This study seeks to conceptually explore the roles of institutional mechanisms and moderating functions of social network structures and cultural values in diffusion of global work values within the context of MNOs. Design/methodology/approach - Adopting a multilevel approach and grounding the arguments in the neo-institutional framework, this work synthesizes cross-cultural research with organizational theory research to present a conceptual model of the diffusion of global work values in the context of MNOs. Findings - It is proposed that the level of diffusion of global work values by members of MNOs is positively related to the level of institutionalization of these values within and between MNOs by means of regulative and normative institutional processes. The arguments also suggest that regulative and normative institutional processes are likely to diffuse global work values more efficiently among members of MNOs with collectivistic value orientations and tight dense social networks with closures. Practical implications - The findings may be useful for managers looking to implement global corporate culture and values programs, searching for the right mechanisms to diffuse values among units with certain cultural backgrounds, social network structures and institutional contexts. Originality/value - This paper combines diverse research streams to elaborate on the dynamic interfaces of global work values diffusion and lays groundwork for future empirical investigations. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201252931", "authid": "57201252931", "authname": "Rosenblatt V.", "surname": "Rosenblatt", "given-name": "Valerie", "initials": "V.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60122671"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "57201252931"}

However, there is limited research on how app-workers' perceptions of these evaluations (perceived algorithmic evaluation, or PAE) affect service performance. Our study addresses this gap in three ways: first, we introduce a new method to measure PAE among app-workers. Second, building on flow theory, we explore how app-workers' flow experience mediates the relationship between PAE and service performance. Third, by integrating the conservation of resources theory and flow theory, we examine how viability challenges might reduce the positive impact of PAE on app-workers' flow experience.

Yet, in order to have such a lasting effect on companies, activist efforts need to pass through multiple stages that deal with both the effective mobilization of their own constituents and the triggering of corporate responses that can induce broader change in the economy. In the present chapter, the authors study how local shareholder activists initiated and helped sustain the process that led to the establishment of active ownership in Switzerland between 1997 and 2011. Active ownership refers to the active engagement of shareholders with firms to push them toward considering environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria in their decision-making.

In addition to the natural entropic tendency to forget, collective memory is also undermined by instrumental \"forgetting work,\" which we conceptualize in this article. Forgetting work involves manipulating short-term conditions of the event, silencing vocal \"rememberers,\" and undermining collective mnemonic traces that sustain a version of the past.

At the field level, we argue that both radical and reformative activist groups direct most of their time and resources towards PRIs with comparatively more stringent standards. At the firm level, while radical activist groups are likely to target firms participating in more stringent PRIs, reformative activist groups target firms participating in less stringent PRIs, or those that do not participate in PRIs at all. When facing unfavourable opportunity structures, CR-based activist groups tend either to advocate the creation of new PRIs or to shift their activities to pressure other focal points.

Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI), governance institutions gathering corporations, civil society and governments, are one type of regulatory mechanisms that tries to fill this gap. However, in order to do so, they have to be democratically legitimate, which induces two main challenges. First, MSIs have to ensure that their structure and processes are perceived as legitimate (input legitimacy). Second, the implementation of their regulations and their problem-solving capacity must be effective (output legitimacy). Governance on a global context is witnessing increasing shifts, such as the development of soft law mechanisms or the participation of private actors in the definition of rules. Therefore, traditional and nationally developed mechanisms for ensuring democratic (input and output) legitimacy, such as elections, cannot simply be applied to global regulatory initiatives such as MSIs. This paper studies this problem by examining the conditions of transfer of input and output legitimacies to MSIs. Precisely, it addresses the following research question: 'What drives input and output legitimacies in MSIs?'. Specifically, driving factors of input and output legitimacies of MSIs are identified and discussed: stakeholder inclusion, democratic deliberations and transparency are deemed to be driving factors of input legitimacy, whereas rule coverage, adequacy, and enforcement are assessed as output legitimacy factors. Then, the interplay between these driving factors are analyzed.", "aggregation_type": "Conference Proceeding", "subtype": "cp", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34977368000", "authid": "34977368000", "authname": "Mena S.", "surname": "Mena", "given-name": "S\u00e9bastien", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9277946900", "authid": "9277946900", "authname": "Palazzo G.", "surname": "Palazzo", "given-name": "Guido", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "34977368000"}

As such, new ways to deal with human rights challenges in corporate operations must be developed as traditional governance mechanisms are not always able to tackle them. This article presents five different views on innovative solutions for the relationships between business and human rights that all build on empowerment, dialogue and constructive engagement. The different approaches highlight an emerging trend toward a more active role for corporations in the protection of human rights. The first examines the need for enhanced dialogue between corporations and their stakeholders. The next three each examine a different facet of empowerment, a critical factor for the respect and protection of human rights: empowerment of the poor, of communities, and of consumers. The final one presents a case study of constructive corporate engagement in Myanmar (Burma). Altogether, these research projects provide insight into the complex relationships between corporate operations and human rights, by highlighting the importance of stakeholder dialogue and empowerment. All the five projects were presented during the Second Swiss Master Class in Corporate Social Responsibility, held in Lausanne, Switzerland on December 12, 2008. The audience for this conference, which examined business and human rights, was composed of researchers, governmental representatives, and business and non-governmental organization practitioners. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.", "aggregation_type": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34977368000", "authid": "34977368000", "authname": "Mena S.", "surname": "Mena", "given-name": "S\u00e9bastien", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60000239"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35762024700", "authid": "35762024700", "authname": "de Leede M.", "surname": "de Leede", "given-name": "Marieke", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60029170"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16030543100", "authid": "16030543100", "authname": "Baumann D.", "surname": "Baumann", "given-name": "Doroth\u00e9e", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012614"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35761924900", "authid": "35761924900", "authname": "Black N.", "surname": "Black", "given-name": "Nicky", "initials": "N.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60004424"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35762431700", "authid": "35762431700", "authname": "Lindeman S.", "surname": "Lindeman", "given-name": "Sara", "initials": "S.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60002505"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35762393300", "authid": "35762393300", "authname": "McShane L.", "surname": "McShane", "given-name": "Lindsay", "initials": "L.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60116580"}]}], "openaccess": "0"}, "final_result": "34977368000"}
